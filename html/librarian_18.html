<h2>Attach packages to the search path, installing them from CRAN, GitHub, or Bioconductor if needed</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Attach packages to the search path, installing them from CRAN, GitHub, or Bioconductor if needed
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">shelf(
  ...,
  lib = NULL,
  update_all = FALSE,
  quiet = FALSE,
  ask = TRUE,
  cran_repo = getOption("repos"),
  bioc_repo = character()
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>...</code></td>
<td>
<p>(Names) Packages as bare names. If the package is from GitHub,
include both the username and package name as UserName/package (see examples).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>lib</code></td>
<td>
<p>(Character) By R convention, packages are installed to the first
folder in your library search path (<code>lib_paths()</code>). Here, you can set a
specific folder to install new packages to instead. If the folder doesn't exist,
you will be prompted to create it if <code>ask = TRUE</code>, otherwise it will be silently
created. Can be an absolute or relative path. Tilde expansion is performed on the
input, but wildcard expansion (globbing) is not. If <code>lib</code> has more than one element,
only the first one will be kept. See the 'Details' section below for more information.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>update_all</code></td>
<td>
<p>(Logical) If <code>TRUE</code>, the packages will be re-installed even if they
are already in your library.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>quiet</code></td>
<td>
<p>(Logical) If <code>TRUE</code>, suppresses most warnings and messages.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>ask</code></td>
<td>
<p>(Logical) If <code>TRUE</code>, and <code>lib</code> points to a folder that doesn't exist, ask
before creating the folder. If <code>FALSE</code>, the folder will be created silently.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>cran_repo</code></td>
<td>
<p>(Character) In RStudio, a default CRAN repo can be set via
<em>Options &gt; Packages &gt; Default CRAN Mirror</em>). Otherwise, provide the URL to CRAN or
one of its mirrors. If an invalid URL is given, defaults to https://cran.r-project.org.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>bioc_repo</code></td>
<td>
<p>(Character) If you use Bioconductor, you can set the repo URLs for it here.
Defaults to Bioconductor's defaults (view them with <code>BiocInstaller::biocinstallRepos()</code>).</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>You may choose to organise your library into folders to hold packages for different
tasks or projects. If you specify a <code>lib</code> folder, it will be created (if needed) and
attached to the package search path. R will look for packages by working through the
package search path in order. You can view the folders that are on this path by
calling <code>lib_paths()</code> with no arguments.
</p>
<p>If you specify a new <code>lib</code> and use the argument <code>update_all = TRUE</code> to force an
already-installed package to reinstall, a new copy of that package will be made in
<code>lib</code> and then loaded from there. This means that you can potentially have several
copies of the same package across many folders on your machine, each a different
version. This allows you to maintain a different library folder for different projects,
so that updated packages in Project B will not affect the package versions you rely on
for Project A.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Invisibly returns a named logical vector, where the names are the packages
requested in <code>...</code> and <code>TRUE</code> means that the package was successfully installed
and attached.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">
shelf(fortunes, DesiQuintans/emptyRpackage, cowsay, lib = tempdir(), update_all = TRUE)

# shelf() returns invisibly; bind its output to a variable or access the .Last.value.

print(.Last.value)

#&gt; fortunes emptyRpackage        cowsay 
#&gt;     TRUE          TRUE          TRUE 


</code></pre>
