<h2>Overlapping Events</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>group_nonoverlapping_events</code> assigns each event to a group such that each group contains no overlaps. <code>has_overlapping_events</code> checks whether an event table has events that overlap.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">group_nonoverlapping_events(e)

has_overlapping_events(e)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>e</code></td>
<td>
<p>An event table.</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>By convention in <code>linbin</code>, events are considered overlapping if they are line events that share more than an endpoint, or point events that have equal endpoints. Point events on line event endpoints are not considered overlaps.
</p>

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">e &lt;- events(c(0, 2, 3), c(3, 4, 5))
cbind(group = group_nonoverlapping_events(e), e)  # adjacent lines do not overlap
e &lt;- events(c(0, 0, 0, 1, 1), c(0, 0, 1, 1, 2))    
cbind(group = group_nonoverlapping_events(e), e)  # equal points do overlap
has_overlapping_events(events(c(0, 2), c(2, 4)))  # adjacent lines
has_overlapping_events(events(c(0, 2), c(3, 4)))  # has overlapping lines
has_overlapping_events(events(c(0, 5, 5, 10)))    # points adjcent to lines
has_overlapping_events(events(c(0, 5, 5, 5, 10))) # has overlapping points
