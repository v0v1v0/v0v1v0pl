<h2>Set maximum number of threads used by LightGBM</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>LightGBM attempts to speed up many operations by using multi-threading.
The number of threads used in those operations can be controlled via the
<code>num_threads</code> parameter passed through <code>params</code> to functions like
lgb.train and lgb.Dataset. However, some operations (like materializing
a model from a text file) are done via code paths that don't explicitly accept thread-control
configuration.
</p>
<p>Use this function to set the maximum number of threads LightGBM will use for such operations.
</p>
<p>This function affects all LightGBM operations in the same process.
</p>
<p>So, for example, if you call <code>setLGBMthreads(4)</code>, no other multi-threaded LightGBM
operation in the same process will use more than 4 threads.
</p>
<p>Call <code>setLGBMthreads(-1)</code> to remove this limitation.
</p>
