<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Water striders are common bugs that skate across the surface of water. Water striders have different personalities
and some of the males are hyper-aggressive, meaning they jump on and wrestle with any other water
strider near them. Individually, because hyper-aggressive males are much more active, they tend to
have better mating success than more inactive striders. This study examined the effect they have on
a group. Four males and three females were put in each of ten pools of water. Half of the groups
had a hyper-aggressive male as one of the males and half did not. The proportion of time females
are in hiding was measured for each of the 10 groups, and a measure of mean mating activity was
also measured with higher numbers meaning more mating.
