<h2>Require usage of <code>expect_gt(x, y)</code> over <code>expect_true(x &gt; y)</code> (and similar)</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>testthat::expect_gt()</code>, <code>testthat::expect_gte()</code>, <code>testthat::expect_lt()</code>,
<code>testthat::expect_lte()</code>, and <code>testthat::expect_equal()</code> exist specifically
for testing comparisons between two objects. <code>testthat::expect_true()</code> can
also be used for such tests, but it is better to use the tailored function
instead.
