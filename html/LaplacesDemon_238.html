</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>parm</code></td>
<td>
<p>This argument requires a vector of initial values equal in
length to the number of parameters. <code>IterativeQuadrature</code> will
attempt to approximate these initial values for the parameters as
means (or posterior modes) of normal integrals. The

<p>This argument accepts an integer that determines the
number of iterations that <code>IterativeQuadrature</code> will attempt
to approximate the posterior with normal
integrals. <code>Iterations</code> defaults to 100.
<code>IterativeQuadrature</code> will stop before this number of
iterations if the tolerance is less than or equal to the
<code>Stop.Tolerance</code> criterion. The required amount of computer
memory increases with <code>Iterations</code>. If computer memory is
exceeded, then all will be lost.</p>

defaults to <code>TRUE</code>. Even when <code>TRUE</code>, posterior samples
are drawn only when <code>IterativeQuadrature</code> has
converged. Posterior samples are required for many other functions,
including <code>plot.iterquad</code> and <code>predict.iterquad</code>. Less
time can be spent on sampling by increasing <code>CPUs</code>, if
available, which parallelizes the sampling.</p>

<p>This argument accepts a vector of two positive
numbers, and defaults to <code>1e-5,1e-15</code>. Tolerance is calculated
each iteration, and the criteria varies by algorithm. The algorithm
is considered to have converged to the user-specified
<code>Stop.Tolerance</code> when the tolerance is less than or equal to
the value of <code>Stop.Tolerance</code>, and the algorithm terminates at
the end of the current iteration. Unless stated otherwise, the
first element is the stop tolerance for the change in <code class="reqn">\mu</code>,
the second element is the stop tolerance for the change in mean
integration error, and the first tolerance must be met before the
second tolerance is considered.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Quadrature is a historical term in mathematics that means determining
area. Mathematicians of ancient Greece, according to the Pythagorean
doctrine, understood determination of area of a figure as the process
of geometrically constructing a square having the same area
(squaring). Thus the name quadrature for this process.
</p>
<p>In medieval Europe, quadrature meant the calculation of area by any
method. With the invention of integral calculus, quadrature has been
applied to the computation of a univariate definite
integral. Numerical integration is a broad family of algorithms for
calculating the numerical value of a definite integral. Numerical
quadrature is a synonym for quadrature applied to one-dimensional
integrals. Multivariate quadrature, also called cubature, is the
application of quadrature to multidimensional integrals.
</p>
<p>A quadrature rule is an approximation of the definite integral of a
function, usually stated as a weighted sum of function values at
specified points within the domain of integration. The specified
points are referred to as abscissae, abscissas, integration points, or
nodes, and have associated weights. The calculation of the nodes and
weights of the quadrature rule differs by the type of
quadrature. There are numerous types of quadrature
algorithms. Bayesian forms of quadrature usually use Gauss-Hermite
quadrature (Naylor and Smith, 1982), and placing a Gaussian Process on
the function is a common extension (O'Hagan, 1991; Rasmussen and
Ghahramani, 2003) that is called ‘Bayesian Quadrature’. Often, these
and other forms of quadrature are also referred to as model-based
integration.
</p>
<p>Gauss-Hermite quadrature uses Hermite polynomials to calculate the
rule. However, there are two versions of Hermite polynomials, which
result in different kernels in different fields. In physics, the
kernel is <code>exp(-x^2)</code>, while in probability the kernel is
<code>exp(-x^2/2)</code>. The weights are a normal density. If the
parameters of the normal distribution, <code class="reqn">\mu</code> and
<code class="reqn">\sigma^2</code>, are estimated from data, then it is referred
to as adaptive Gauss-Hermite quadrature, and the parameters are the
conditional mean and conditional variance. Outside of Gauss-Hermite
quadrature, adaptive quadrature implies that a difficult range in the
integrand is subdivided with more points until it is
well-approximated. Gauss-Hermite quadrature performs well when the
integrand is smooth, and assumes normality or multivariate normality.
Adaptive Gauss-Hermite quadrature has been demonstrated to outperform
Gauss-Hermite quadrature in speed and accuracy.
</p>
<p>A goal in quadrature is to minimize integration error, which is the
error between the evaluations and the weights of the rule. Therefore,
a goal in Bayesian Gauss-Hermite quadrature is to minimize integration
error while approximating a marginal posterior distribution that is
assumed to be smooth and normally-distributed. This minimization often
occurs by increasing the number of nodes until a change in mean
integration error is below a tolerance, rather than minimizing
integration error itself, since the target may be only approximately
normally distributed, or minimizing the sum of integration error,
which would change with the number of nodes.
</p>
<p>To approximate integrals in multiple dimensions, one approach applies
<code class="reqn">N</code> nodes of a univariate quadrature rule to multiple dimensions
(using the <code>GaussHermiteCubeRule</code> function for example)
via the product rule, which results in many more multivariate nodes.
This requires the number of function evaluations to grow exponentially
as dimension increases. Multidimensional quadrature is usually limited
to less than ten dimensions, both due to the number of nodes required,
and because the accuracy of multidimensional quadrature algorithms
decreases as the dimension increases. Three methods may overcome this
curse of dimensionality in varying degrees: componentwise quadrature,
sparse grids, and Monte Carlo.
</p>
<p>Componentwise quadrature is the iterative application of univariate
quadrature to each parameter. It is applicable with high-dimensional
models, but sacrifices the ability to calculate the conditional
covariance matrix, and calculates only the variance of each parameter.
</p>
<p>Sparse grids were originally developed by Smolyak for
multidimensional quadrature. A sparse grid is based on a
one-dimensional quadrature rule. Only a subset of the nodes from the
product rule is included, and the weights are appropriately rescaled.
Although a sparse grid is more efficient because it reduces the
number of nodes to achieve the same accuracy, the user must contend
with increasing the accuracy of the grid, and it remains inapplicable
to high-dimensional integrals.
</p>
<p>Monte Carlo is a large family of sampling-based algorithms. O'Hagan
(1987) asserts that Monte Carlo is frequentist, inefficient, regards
irrelevant information, and disregards relevant information.
Quadrature, he maintains (O'Hagan, 1992), is the most Bayesian
approach, and also the most efficient. In high dimensions, he
concedes, a popular subset of Monte Carlo algorithms is currently the
best for cheap model function evaluations. These algorithms are called
Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). High-dimensional models with
expensive model evaluation functions, however, are not well-suited to
MCMC. A large number of MCMC algorithms is available in the
<code>LaplacesDemon</code> function.
</p>
<p>Following are some reasons to consider iterative quadrature rather
than MCMC. Once an MCMC sampler finds equilibrium, it must then draw
enough samples to represent all targets. Iterative quadrature does not
need to continue drawing samples. Multivariate quadrature is
consistently reported as more efficient than MCMC when its assumptions
hold, though multivariate quadrature is limited to small dimensions.
High-dimensional models therefore default to MCMC, between the two.
Componentwise quadrature algorithms like CAGH, however, may also be
more efficient with cloc-time than MCMC in high dimensions, especially
against componentwise MCMC algorithms. Another reason to consider
iterative quadrature are that assessing convergence in MCMC is a
difficult topic, but not for iterative quadrature. A user of
iterative quadrature does not have to contend with effective sample
size and autocorrelation, assessing stationarity, acceptance rates,
diminishing adaptation, etc. Stochastic sampling in MCMC is less
efficient when samples occur in close proximity (such as when highly
autocorrelated), whereas in quadrature the nodes are spread out by
design.
</p>
<p>In general, the conditional means and conditional variances progress
smoothly to the target in multidimensional quadrature. For
componentwise quadrature, movement to the target is not smooth, and
often resembles a Markov chain or optimization algorithm.
</p>
<p>Iterative quadrature is often applied after
<code>LaplaceApproximation</code> to obtain a more reliable
estimate of parameter variance or covariance than the negative inverse
of the <code>Hessian</code> matrix of second derivatives, which is
suitable only when the contours of the logarithm of the unnormalized
joint posterior density are approximately ellipsoidal (Naylor and
Smith, 1982, p. 224).
</p>
<p>When <code>Algorithm="AGH"</code>, the Naylor and Smith (1982) algorithm
is used. The AGH algorithm uses multivariate quadrature with the
physicist's (not the probabilist's) kernel.
</p>
<p>There are four algorithm specifications: <code>N</code> is the number of
univariate nodes, <code>Nmax</code> is the maximum number of univariate
nodes, <code>Packages</code> accepts any package required for the model
function when parallelized, and <code>Dyn.libs</code> accepts dynamic
libraries for parallelization, if required. The number of univariate
nodes begins at <code class="reqn">N</code> and increases by one each iteration. The
number of multivariate nodes grows quickly with <code class="reqn">N</code>. Naylor and
Smith (1982) recommend beginning with as few nodes as <code class="reqn">N=3</code>. Any
of the following events will cause <code class="reqn">N</code> to increase by 1 when
<code class="reqn">N</code> is less than <code>Nmax</code>:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> All LP weights are zero (and non-finite weights are set to zero)
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code class="reqn">\mu</code> does not result in an increase in LP
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> All elements in <code class="reqn">\Sigma</code> are not finite
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> The square root of the sum of the squared changes in <code class="reqn">\mu</code>
is less than or equal to the <code>Stop.Tolerance</code>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Tolerance includes two metrics: change in mean integration error and
change in parameters. Including the change in parameters for tolerance
was not mentioned in Naylor and Smith (1982).
</p>
<p>Naylor and Smith (1982) consider a transformation due to correlation.
This is not included here.
</p>
<p>The AGH algorithm does not currently handle constrained parameters,
such as with the <code>interval</code> function. If a parameter is
constrained and changes during a model evaluation, this changes the
node and the multivariate weight. This is currently not corrected.
</p>
<p>An advantage of AGH over componentwise adaptive quadrature is that
AGH estimates covariance, where a componentwise algorithm ignores
it. A disadvantage of AGH over a componentwise algorithm is that
the number of nodes increases so quickly with dimension, that AGH is
limited to small-dimensional models.
</p>
<p>When <code>Algorithm="AGHSG"</code>, the Naylor and Smith (1982) algorithm
is applied to a sparse grid, rather than a traditional multivariate
quadrature rule. This is identical to the AGH algorithm above, except
that a sparse grid replaces the multivariate quadrature rule.
</p>
<p>The sparse grid reduces the number of nodes. The cost of reducing the
number of nodes is that the user must consider the accuracy, <code class="reqn">K</code>.
</p>
<p>There are four algorithm specifications: <code>K</code> is the accuracy (as a
positive integer), <code>Kmax</code> is the maximum accuracy,
<code>Packages</code> accepts any package required for the model function
when parallelized, and <code>Dyn.libs</code> accepts dynamic libraries for
parallelization, if required. These arguments represent accuracy
rather than the number of univariate nodes, but otherwise are similar
to the AGH algorithm.
</p>
<p>When <code>Algorithm="CAGH"</code>, a componentwise version of the adaptive
Gauss-Hermite quadrature of Naylor and Smith (1982) is used. Each
iteration, each marginal posterior distribution is approximated
sequentially, in a random order, with univariate quadrature. The
conditional mean and conditional variance are also approximated each
iteration, making it an adaptive algorithm.
</p>
<p>There are four algorithm specifications: <code>N</code> is the number of
nodes, <code>Nmax</code> is the maximum number of nodes, <code>Packages</code>
accepts any package required for the model function when parallelized,
and <code>Dyn.libs</code> accepts dynamic libraries for parallelization, if
required. The number of nodes begins at <code class="reqn">N</code>. All parameters have
the same number of nodes. Any of the following events will cause
<code class="reqn">N</code> to increase by 1 when <code class="reqn">N</code> is less than <code>Nmax</code>, and
these conditions refer to all parameters (not individually):
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> Any LP weights are not finite
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> All LP weights are zero
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code class="reqn">\mu</code> does not result in an increase in LP
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> The square root of the sum of the squared changes in <code class="reqn">\mu</code>
is less than or equal to the <code>Stop.Tolerance</code>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It is recommended to begin with <code>N=3</code> and set <code>Nmax</code> between
10 and 100. As long as CAGH does not experience problematic weights,
and as long as CAGH is improving LP with <code class="reqn">\mu</code>, the number of nodes
does not increase. When CAGH becomes either universally problematic or
universally stable, then <code class="reqn">N</code> slowly increases until the sum of
both the mean integration error and the sum of the squared changes in
<code class="reqn">\mu</code> is less than the <code>Stop.Tolerance</code> for two consecutive
iterations.
</p>
<p>If the highest LP occurs at the lowest or highest node, then the value
at that node becomes the conditional mean, rather than calculating it
from all weighted samples; this facilitates movement when the current
integral is poorly centered toward a well-centered integral. If all
weights are zero, then a random proposal is generated with a small
variance.
</p>
<p>Tolerance includes two metrics: change in mean integration error and
change in parameters, as the square root of the sum of the squared
differences.
</p>
<p>When a parameter constraint is encountered, the node and weight of the
quadrature rule is recalculated.
</p>
<p>An advantage of CAGH over multidimensional adaptive quadrature is that
CAGH may be applied in large dimensions. Disadvantages of CAGH are
that only variance, not covariance, is estimated, and ignoring
covariance may be problematic.

logarithmic form of equation 4 in Lewis and Raftery (1997). As a
rough estimate of Kass and Raftery (1995), the LME-based LML is
worrisome when the sample size of the data is less than five times
the number of parameters, and <code>LML</code> should be adequate in most
problems when the sample size of the data exceeds twenty times the
