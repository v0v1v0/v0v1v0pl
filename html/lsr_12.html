<h2>Chi-square test against specified probabilities</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Convenience function that runs a chi-square goodness of fit
test against specified probabilities. This is a wrapper function intended
to be used for pedagogical purposes only.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">goodnessOfFitTest(x, p = NULL)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>Factor variable containing the raw outcomes.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>p</code></td>
<td>
<p>Numeric variable containing the null-hypothesis probabilities (default = all outcomes equally likely)</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The <code>goodnessOfFitTest</code> function runs the chi-square
goodness of fit test of the hypothesis that the outcomes in the factor
<code>x</code> were generated according to the probabilities in the vector
<code>p</code>. The probability vector <code>p</code> must be a numeric variable
of length <code>nlevels(x)</code>. If no probabilities are specified, all
outcomes are assumed to be equally likely.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>An object of class 'gofTest'. When printed, the output is
organised into four short sections. The first section lists the name
of the test and the variables included. The second lists the null and
alternative hypotheses for the test. The third shows the observed
frequency table, the expected frequency table under the null hypothesis,
and the probabilities specified by the null. The fourth prints out the
test results.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R"># raw data
gender &lt;- factor(
  c( "male","male","male","male","female","female",
     "female","male","male","male" ))

# goodness of fit test against the hypothesis that males and
# females occur with equal frequency
goodnessOfFitTest( gender )

# goodness of fit test against the hypothesis that males appear
# with probability .6 and females with probability .4.
goodnessOfFitTest( gender, p=c(.4,.6) )
goodnessOfFitTest( gender, p=c(female=.4,male=.6) )
goodnessOfFitTest( gender, p=c(male=.6,female=.4) )
