<h2>Load treatment parameters</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Loads a list of treatment parameters for a specific disease (initialised at 0
, i.e. absence of treatments)
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">loadTreatment(disease = "no pathogen")
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>disease</code></td>
<td>
<p>a disease name, among "mildew", "sigatoka" and "no pathogen"</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Chemical treatment is applied in a polygon only if disease severity (i.e. I/N) in
this polygon exceeds the threshold given by <code>treatment_application_threshold</code>.
Treatment efficiency is maximum (i.e. equal to the parameter treatment_efficiency)
at the time of treatment application (noted <code class="reqn">t*</code>); then it decreases with time
(i.e. natural pesticide degradation) and host growth (i.e. new biomass is not protected
by treatments):                                                                                                                                                                                     protected by treatments):Efficiency of the treatment at time t after the application date is given by:
<code class="reqn"> efficiency(t) = treatment\_efficiency / (1 + exp(a-b*C(t))) </code>
with <code class="reqn"> C(t)= C_1 * C_2</code>: </p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><code class="reqn">C_1 = exp(- treatment\_degradation\_rate * \Delta t) </code> is the reduction of
fungicide concentration due to time (e.g. natural degradation, volatilization, weathering),
with <code class="reqn">\Delta t = t - t*</code> the timelag passed since the time of
treatment application.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code class="reqn"> C_2 = min(1, N(t*) / N(t)) </code> is the reduction of fungicide concentration due
to plant growth, since new plant tissue is not covered by fungicide.
<code class="reqn">N(t*)</code> and <code class="reqn">N(t)</code> being the number of
host individuals  a the time of treatment <code class="reqn">t*</code> and at time <code class="reqn">t</code>, respectively.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code class="reqn">a \in [3.5 ; 4.5]</code> and <code class="reqn">b \in [8 ; 9]</code> are shape parameters.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>a list of treatment parameters:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> treatment_degradation_rate = degradation rate (per time step) of chemical concentration,
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> treatment_efficiency = maximal efficiency of chemical treatments (i.e. fractional reduction
of pathogen infection rate at the time of application),
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> treatment_timesteps = vector of time steps corresponding to treatment application dates,
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> treatment_cultivars = vector of indices of the cultivars that receive treatments,
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> treatment_cost = cost of a single treatment application (monetary units/ha)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> treatment_application_threshold = vector of thresholds (i.e. disease severity, one
for each treated cultivar) above which the treatment is applied in a polygon.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
