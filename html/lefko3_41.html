<h2>Demographic Dataset of <em>Lathyrus vernus</em> Population</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A dataset containing the states and fates of <em>Lathyrus vernus</em> (spring
vetch), family Fabaceae, from a population in Sweden monitored annually
from 1988 to 1991 in six study plots.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(lathyrus)
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 1119 individuals and 34 variables. Each row
corresponds to a unique individual, and each variable from <code>Volume88</code>
on refers to the state of the individual in a given year.
</p>

<dl>
<dt>SUBPLOT</dt>
<dd>
<p>A variable refering to patch within the population.</p>
</dd>
<dt>GENET</dt>
<dd>
<p>A numeric variable giving a unique number to each 
individual.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Volume88</dt>
<dd>
<p>Aboveground volume in cubic mm in 1988.</p>
</dd>
<dt>lnVol88</dt>
<dd>
<p>Natural logarithm of <code>Volume88</code>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>FCODE88</dt>
<dd>
<p>Equals 1 if flowering and 0 if not flowering in 1988.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Flow88</dt>
<dd>
<p>Number of flowers in 1988.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Intactseed88</dt>
<dd>
<p>Number of intact mature seeds produced in 1988.
Not always an integer, as in some cases seed number was estimated via 
linear modeling.</p>
</dd>

<dd>
<p>Marked as 1 if known to be dead in 1988.</p>
</dd>

<em>t</em>. Numbers refer to certainty of assignment: 1 = certain that plant
is a seedling in 1988, 2 = likely that plant is a seedling in 1988,
