<h2>Spinal Bone Mineral Density (Extended) Data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>These are measures on spinal areal bone mineral density.  The data
are taken from the "large" bone density dataset on the source website (see source).
</p>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 1003 rows and 5 variables
</p>

<dl>
<dt>idnum</dt>
<dd>
<p>Identifies the subject, and hence the repeat measurements</p>
</dd>
<dt>ethnic</dt>
<dd>
<p>The "ethnicity/race" of the subject.  A factor with levels 
"Asian", "Black", "Hispanic", and "White".</p>
</dd>
<dt>age</dt>
<dd>
<p>The age in years of the subject at the time the measurement <code>spnbmd</code> was taken.</p>
</dd>
<dt>sex</dt>
<dd>
<p>Sex of the subject.  A factor with levels "female" and "male".</p>
</dd>
<dt>spnbmd</dt>
<dd>
<p>The spinal areal bone mineral density (BMD) measurement 
in grams per square centimetre.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The row order of the values follow their order of appearence in the source webpage.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The purpose of the study was to examine ethnic and sex differences in bone mineral acquisition over
time for young (aged 9-25 years) healthy Asian, Black, Hispanic, and White males and females.
The study recorded areal bone mineral density (BMD) in grams per square centimetre in the lumbar spine.
</p>
<p>The sample was a convenience sample of 423 healthy young people of various "ethnicities." 
</p>
<p>On the subjects (Bachrach et al, 1999): 
</p>
<p>"A convenience sample of healthy youth was recruited from the community
through advertisements and personal contact. Individuals
with a history of medical conditions or use of medications affecting
bone mineral were excluded. Subjects were encouraged to return annually
for a total of four visits or until they had reached age 26 yr.
Recruitment occurred between May 1992 and February 1996; data collection
ended in February 1997. The cohort at entry included 103 non-Hispanic whites, 
103 Hispanics, 103 Asians, and 114 non-Hispanic blacks, aged 8.8 â€“25.9 yr; 
230 females and 193 males were enrolled as previously reported (22). 
For simplicity, ethnicity and race will be used as interchangeable terms, 
and the groups will be referred to as white, Hispanic, Asian, and black.
A total of 280 subjects completed 2 visits; 189 were studied 3 times, and 
113 were evaluated 4 times. Subjects who completed fewer than 4 visits included 
those who refused, relocated, or reached age 26 yr during the study period; 
in addition, subjects who were recruited late in the study did not complete 
all visits because funding had terminated."
