<h2>Defines vector as range</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Redefines the class of a vector as "range"
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">ranges(x, y)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>first element</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>y</code></td>
<td>
<p>second element</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>'c(x, y)', but with the "range" class
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>This function was created to be used as an element in the 'N' argument of 'cluster_gen'. The name was chosen to avoid conflict with 'base::range()'.
</p>
<p>'ranges()' should always be used within a 'list()'. Inserting a "range" vector inside a common vector ('c()') will result in a common vector. For example, 'c(3, ranges(8, 10))' is the same as 'c(3, 8, 10)', because when faced with conflicting classes in the same element, R will resolve to the simpler case ("numeric", in this case). An easier way to understand this concept is by checking 'class(c(3, "a"))' is "character", meaning the number 3 was devolved into a character "3".
