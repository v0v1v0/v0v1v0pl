<h2>Berkeley admissions data, 1973</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A well-known example dataset, used as an excellent example for Simpson's Paradox.
The Wikipedia page (see source), describes: "The admission figures for the fall of 1973 showed
that men applying were more likely than women to be admitted, and the difference was so large
that it was unlikely to be due to chance. But when examining the individual departments, it
appeared that six out of 85 departments were significantly biased against men, whereas only
four were significantly biased against women. In fact, the pooled and corrected data showed
a 'small but statistically significant bias in favor of women.'"
