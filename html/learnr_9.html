<h2>Register an event handler callback</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Register an event handler on a per-tutorial basis. Handlers for an event will
be fired in the order that they were registered.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">event_register_handler(event, callback)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>event</code></td>
<td>
<p>The name of an event.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>callback</code></td>
<td>
<p>A function to be invoked when an event with a specified name
occurs. The callback must take parameters <code>session</code>, <code>event</code>, and <code>data</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>In most cases, this will be called within a learnr document. If that is the
case, then the handler will exist as long as the document (that is, the Shiny
application) is running.
</p>
<p>If this function is called in a learnr .Rmd document, it should be in a chunk
with <code>context="server-start"</code>. If it is called with <code>context="server"</code>, the
handler will be registered at least two times (once for the application as a
whole, and once per user session).
</p>
<p>If this function is called outside of a learnr document, then the handler
will persist until the learnr package is unloaded, typically when the R
session is stopped.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A function which, if invoked, will remove the callback.
