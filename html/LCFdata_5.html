<h2>Plotting data generated from a linear mixed-effects model from Tremblay &amp; Newman (In Preparation).</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The model call is:
lmer(formula = Amplitude ~ FreqBc * LengthBc * WMCc + 
(1 | Subject) + (1 | Item) + (0 + WMCc | Item), data = dat)
</p>
<p>(see <em>details</em> for more).
</p>
<p>The plotting data was generated from this model with function <code>plotLMER3d.fnc</code>.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(z)</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>The format is:
num [1:30, 1:10] -1.83 -1.95 -2.07 -2.19 -2.32 ...
- attr(*, "dimnames")=List of 2
..$ : chr [1:30] "-2.88262910798122" "-2.50331876315363" "-2.12400841832605" "-1.74469807349846" ...
..$ : chr [1:10] "-0.1857142855" "-0.1410714285" "-0.0517857144999999" "-0.0428571424999999" ...
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The model includes a three-way interaction between <em>WMCc</em> (mean-centered working memory capacity), <em>FreqBc</em> (the frequency of use of the second word of a four-word sequence), and <em>LengthBc</em> (the length in number of letters of the second work of a four-word sequence) in addition to by-subject and by-item random intercepts and by-item random slopes for <em>WMCc</em>.</p>
