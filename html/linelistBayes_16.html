<h2>Calculate Proportions of Event Counts Within a Specified Time Range</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function calculates the proportion of event counts that occur within each
unit of time from a specified starting point (onset time) up to a maximum delay.
The proportions are computed relative to the total number of events occurring within
the specified time range.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">prop(x, onset, maxdelay, cd)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>NumericVector representing the count of events at each time point.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>onset</code></td>
<td>
<p>NumericVector representing the onset times for each event count.
Each element in the vector indicates the time at which an event was initiated.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>maxdelay</code></td>
<td>
<p>The maximum time delay (inclusive) for which the proportions are calculated.
This parameter defines the upper bound of the time interval over which the proportions
of event counts are evaluated.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>cd</code></td>
<td>
<p>The onset time (exclusive) from which to start calculating proportions.
Events that start at times less than or equal to this value are excluded from the calculation.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>NumericVector containing the proportions of the total events falling within each unit
of time from the specified 'cd' up to 'maxdelay'. The proportions are cumulative,
with each element representing the proportion of events that have occurred by that time point,
starting from 'cd'.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">x &lt;- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10)
onset &lt;- c(1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5)
maxdelay &lt;- 5
cd &lt;- 1
prop(x, onset, maxdelay, cd)
