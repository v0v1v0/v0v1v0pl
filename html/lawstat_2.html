<h2>Prediction Errors ("Biases") of Surface Temperature Forecasts</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Prediction errors of 48-hour ahead MM5 forecasts of surface temperature measured 
at 96 locations in the US Pacific Northwest on 3-January-2000. The prediction error, 
or "bias", is the difference between the forecasted and observed surface
temperature. (MM5 is the fifth-generation Pennsylvania State University â€“ 
National Center for Atmospheric Research Mesoscale Model.)
