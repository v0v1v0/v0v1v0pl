<h2>Determine the function referred to by the "_HANDLER" environment variable</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function will try to identify the function referred to by the "_HANDLER"
environment variable. This environment variable is configured by AWS Lambda,
either through the CMD of the Dockerfile containing the runtime or through
the AWS Lambda console (which takes priority). This function also performs
some checks, making sure that the environment variable is defined and that
it exists in the given environment, and that it's a function.
</p>
