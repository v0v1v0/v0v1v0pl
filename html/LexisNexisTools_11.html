<h2>An S4 class to store the three data.frames created with lnt_read</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This S4 class stores the output from lnt_read. Just like a spreadsheet
with multiple worksheets, an LNToutput object consist of three data.frames
which you can select using <code>@</code>. This object class is intended to be an
intermediate container. As it stores articles and paragraphs in two separate
data.frames, nested in an S4 object, the relevant text data is stored twice
in almost the same format. This has the advantage, that there is no need to
use special characters, such as "\n" to indicate a new paragraph. However,
it makes the files rather big when you save them directly. They should thus
usually be subsetted using <code>@</code> or converted to a different format using
lnt_convert.
