<h2>locaR: A Set of Tools for Sound Localization.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The locaR package contains functions for localizing sounds using R.
Localizations are carried out using the modified steered response power
algorithm of Cobos et al. (2011) which carries out a grid-search to find
the location in three dimensions where a sound was most likely to have
originated.
