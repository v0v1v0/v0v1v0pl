<h2>Judgment samples of plastic blocks</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Thirty-three graduate students were shown a set of 100 "physical blocks" of different shapes and sizes, all cut from a single sheet of opaque plastic a few millimetres thick (see  <code>blocks</code>).
</p>
<p>The blocks were numbered 1 to 100 and each student was asked to choose 10 blocks whose average weight would, in their judgment,  equal the average weight of all 100 blocks.
The only information available to each student to help them make their choice was the visual shape and size of all 100 blocks.
They had a few minutes each to make and record their choices.
</p>
<p>The task was presented as a competition with a prize to go to the student whose sample came closest to the population average weight.
</p>
<p>Actual block weights and other information are available in the dataset <code>blocks</code>.
</p>
