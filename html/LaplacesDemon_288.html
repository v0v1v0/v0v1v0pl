<h2>Plot samples from the output of MISS</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This may be used to plot, or save plots of, samples in an object of
class <code>miss</code>. Plots include a trace plot, density plot, and
autocorrelation or ACF plot.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">## S3 method for class 'miss'
plot(x, PDF=FALSE, ...)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>

<p>This required argument is an object of class <code>miss</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>PDF</code></td>
<td>

<p>This logical argument indicates whether or not the user wants
Laplace's Demon to save the plots as a .pdf file.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The plots are arranged in a <code class="reqn">3 \times 3</code> matrix. Each row
represents the predictive distribution of a missing value. The
left column displays trace plots, the middle column displays kernel
density plots, and the right column displays autocorrelation (ACF)
plots.
</p>
<p>Trace plots show the thinned history of the predictive distribution,
with its value in the y-axis moving by iteration across the x-axis.
Simulations of a predictive distribution with good properties do not
suggest a trend upward or downward as it progresses across the x-axis
(it should appear stationary), and it should mix well, meaning it
should appear as though random samples are being taken each time from
the same target distribution. Visual inspection of a trace plot cannot
verify convergence, but apparent non-stationarity or poor mixing can
certainly suggest non-convergence. A red, smoothed line also appears
to aid visual inspection.
</p>
<p>Kernel density plots depict the marginal posterior distribution.
There is no distributional assumption about this density.
</p>
<p>Autocorrelation plots show the autocorrelation or serial correlation
between sampled values at nearby iterations. Samples with
autocorrelation do not violate any assumption, but are inefficient
because they reduce the effective sample size (<code>ESS</code>), and
indicate that the chain is not mixing well, since each value is
influenced by values that are previous and nearby. The x-axis
indicates lags with respect to samples by iteration, and the y-axis
represents autocorrelation. The ideal autocorrelation plot shows
perfect correlation at zero lag, and quickly falls to zero
autocorrelation for all other lags.
