<h2>Point-based metrics</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Computes a series of user-defined descriptive statistics for a LiDAR dataset for each point based
on its k-nearest neighbours or its sphere neighbourhood.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">point_metrics(las, func, k, r, xyz = FALSE, filter = NULL, ...)

point_eigenvalues(
  las,
  k,
  r,
  xyz = FALSE,
  metrics = FALSE,
  coeffs = FALSE,
  filter = NULL
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>las</code></td>
<td>
<p>An object of class LAS</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>func</code></td>
<td>
<p>formula. An expression to be applied to each point neighbourhood (see also
template_metrics).</p>
</td>

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>k, r</code></td>
<td>
<p>integer and numeric respectively for k-nearest neighbours and radius of the neighborhood
sphere. If k is given and r is missing, computes with the knn, if r is given and k is missing
computes with a sphere neighborhood, if k and r are given computes with the knn and a limit on the
search distance.</p>

<p>logical. Coordinates of each point are returned in addition to each metric. Otherwise an

</td>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>When the neighbourhood is knn the user-defined function is fed with the current
processed point and its k-1 neighbours. The current point being considered as
the 1-neighbour with a distance 0 to the reference point. The points are ordered
by distance to the central point. When the neighbourhood is a sphere the processed
point is also included in the query but points are coming in a random order. <code>point_eigenmetrics</code>
computes the eigenvalues of the covariance matrix and computes associated metrics following
Lucas et al, 2019 (see references). It is equivalent to <code>point_metrics(las, .stdshapemetrics)</code>
but much faster because it is optimized and parallelized internally.
</p>


<h3>Performances</h3>

<p>It is important to bear in mind that this function is very fast for the feature it provides i.e.
mapping a user-defined function at the point level using optimized memory management. However, it
is still computationally demanding.<br><br>
To help users to get an idea of how computationally demanding this function is, let's compare it to
pixel_metrics. Assuming we want to apply <code>mean(Z)</code> on a 1 km² tile with 1 point/m²
with a resolution of 20 m (400 m² cells), then the function <code>mean</code> is called roughly 2500
times (once  per cell). On the contrary, with <code>point_metrics</code>, <code>mean</code> is called 1000000
times (once per point). So the function is expected to be more than 400 times slower in this specific
case (but it does not provide the same feature).<br><br>
This is why the user-defined function is expected to be well-optimized, otherwise it might drastically
slow down this already heavy computation. See examples.
