<h2>A.A. Michelson's 1879 Determinations of the Speed of Light</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>In 1879, Albert Abraham Michelson conducted an experimental study to
determine the speed of light using a rotating mirror apparatus at the
U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland in 1879.  
</p>
<p>Details on the apparatus, the optical theory, and the conduct of the experiment are
given in the reference.  An abbreviated summary of these follows the variable descriptions.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The experiment is conducted within a closed and darkened small building at the U.S. Naval Academy.
Light enters the building from one corner passing through a slit 'S' whose location is
precisely determined using a micrometer.  
</p>
<p>The light then proceeds to hit a rotating mirror
at the other end of the building's interior from whence it is reflected out of the
building through an opening in a corner different from that of the source.  
</p>
<p>The light 
beam travels outside to strike another (stationary) mirror which reflects it back into the
building through the same corner it exited whereupon it then strikes the rotating mirror.
</p>
<p>Depending on the position of the rotating mirror, the returning light will be reflected off
it to land at some position 'I' near the original source given by the slit 'S'.
</p>
<p>The speed of the rotating mirror is controlled using an adjustable pump to blow air across a surface to
rotate it.  
If the speed of rotation is just right, a crisp image 'I' of the reflected slit will appear near
the original source 'S'.  The speed is adjusted until this is the case.
</p>
<p>The speed of rotation is determined using an electric tuning fork connected to the
rotating mirror and whose frequency was measured by comparing it to a second standard tunig
fork of known frequency.  The electronic fork frequency was compared to the standard fork
by determining the number of beats per second difference the two (by counting over 60 seconds).
</p>
<p>With a speed of revolution and the displacement measured between 'S' and its returned image 'I', 
a measurement of the speed of light could be had.
