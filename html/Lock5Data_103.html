<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Eleven healthy non-tea-drinking individuals were asked to drink five or six cups of tea a day, while ten healthy non-tea and non-coffee-drinkers were asked to drink the same amount of
coffee, which has caffeine but not the L-theanine that is in tea. The groups were randomly assigned.
After two weeks, blood samples were exposed to an antigen and production of interferon gamma was
measured.
