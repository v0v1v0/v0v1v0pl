<h3>Note</h3>

<p>This dataset is a bit messy and ambiguous in places,
because history is like that. In fact, the messy parts of
the dataset are in general a good indicator that
soemthing interesting was happening at the time. (See,
for example, missing or multiple rulers, starts and ends
of reigns in the same year, and rulers that appear
several times with different territories.)  Evan defining
a monarch of England is tricky. Most of the monarchs in
this dataset were around before England existed (it
consisted of seven territories called the heptarchy). The
data stops before John I (the bad guy from the Robin Hood
stories) because he proclaimed himself King of Ireland,
although some people consider monarchs up to Anne, five
hundred years later, to be English Monarchs even though
they ruled over Ireland, Wales and Scotland to varying
degrees.
</p>
<p>The heptarchy consisted of East Anglia, Essex, Kent,
Mercia, Northumbria, Sussex and Wessex.  Northubria was
originally divided into Deria and Bernicia.  There are
also periods of Norse and Danish rule.
</p>
<p>The dataset was compiled from Wikipedia and thus is not
guaranteed to be error free.  Please double check the
data if you want to use it for something serious.
