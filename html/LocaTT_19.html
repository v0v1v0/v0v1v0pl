<h2>Truncate DNA Sequences to Specified Length</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Truncates DNA sequences to a specified length.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">truncate_sequences.length(sequences, length, quality_scores)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>sequences</code></td>
<td>
<p>A character vector of DNA sequences to truncate.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>length</code></td>
<td>
<p>Numeric. The length to truncate DNA sequences to.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>quality_scores</code></td>
<td>
<p>An optional character vector of DNA sequence quality scores. If supplied, these will be truncated to their corresponding truncated DNA sequences.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>If quality scores are not provided, then a character vector of truncated DNA sequences is returned. If quality scores are provided, then a list containing two elements is returned. The first element is a character vector of truncated DNA sequences, and the second element is a character vector of quality scores which have been truncated to their corresponding truncated DNA sequences.
</p>
