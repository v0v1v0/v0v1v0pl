<h2>Power and Sample Size Calculation for Non-Proportional Hazards
and Beyond</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Performs power and sample size calculation for
non-proportional hazards model using the Fleming-Harrington family
of weighted log-rank tests.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>For proportional hazards, the power is determined by the
total number of events and the constant hazard ratio along with
information rates and spending functions. For
non-proportional hazards, the hazard ratio varies over time and
the calendar time plays a key role in determining the mean and
variance of the log-rank test score statistic. It requires an
iterative algorithm to find the calendar time at which the
targeted number of events will be reached for each interim
analysis. The lrstat package uses the analytic method
in Lu (2021) to find the mean and variance of the weighted
log-rank test score statistic at each interim analysis. In
addition, the package approximates the variance and covariance
matrix of the sequentially calculated log-rank test statistics
under the alternative hypothesis with that under the null hypothesis
to take advantage of the independent increments structure in
Tsiatis (1982) applicable for the Fleming-Harrington family
of weighted log-rank tests.
</p>
<p>The most useful functions in the package are <code>lrstat</code>,
<code>lrpower</code>, <code>lrsamplesize</code>, and <code>lrsim</code>, which calculate
the mean and variance of log-rank test score statistic at a sequence
of given calendar times, the power of the log-rank test, the sample
size in terms of accrual duration and follow-up duration, and the
log-rank test simulation, respectively. The <code>accrual</code> function
calculates the number of patients accrued at given calendar times. The
<code>caltime</code> function finds the calendar times to reach the targeted
number of events. The <code>exitprob</code> function calculates the stagewise
exit probabilities for specified boundaries with a varying mean
parameter over time based on an adaptation of the recursive
integration algorithm described in Chapter 19 of Jennison and
Turnbull (2000).
</p>
<p>The development of the lrstat package is heavily influenced by
the rpact package. We find their function arguments to be
self-explanatory. We have used the same names whenever appropriate
so that users familiar with the rpact package can learn the
lrstat package quickly. However, there are notable differences:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> lrstat uses direct approximation, while rpact uses the Schoenfeld
method for log-rank test power and sample size calculation.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> lrstat uses <code>accrualDuration</code> to explicitly set the end of
accrual period, while rpact incorporates the end of accrual period
in <code>accrualTime</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> lrstat considers the trial a failure at the last stage if
the log-rank test cannot reject the null hypothesis up to this
stage and cannot stop for futility at an earlier stage.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> the <code>lrsim</code> function uses the variance of the log-rank
test score statistic as the information.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to the log-rank test power and sample size calculations,
the lrstat package can also be used for the following tasks:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> design generic group sequential trials.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> design generic group sequential equivalence trials.
</p>
</li>

size, error spending function, number and spacing or future looks.

</li>

</p>
</li>

with or without design changes.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> perform multiplicity adjustment based on graphical approaches
using weighted Bonferroni tests, Bonferroni mixture of weighted
Simes test, and Bonferroni mixture of Dunnett test as well as
group sequential trials with multiple hypotheses.
</p>
</li>

procedures for two sequences of hypotheses and the standard or
modified mixture gatekeeping procedures in the general case.
