<h2>Plasma Etching</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>An experiment designed to guide optimization of a nitride etch process
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">	data(Plasma)
</code></pre>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>An orthogonal arry, capable of supporting a linear model only. The 
factors are denoted by their units of measurement. They were W, 
the power applied to the cathode; mTorr, the pressure
in the reaction chamber; cm, gap between anode and cathode; sscm, flow
if the reactant gas. The three responses: Amin, etch rate; Pct, unifomity;
sinpoly, selectivity.
