<h2>LOESS Smoothing of Outcome by Treatment in Supervised Propensiy Scoring</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Express Expected Outcome by Treatment as LOESS Smooths of Fitted Propensity Scores.

<td><code>faclev</code></td>
<td>
<p>optional; maximum number of distinct numerical values a variable can assume

<p>SPSloess
</p>
<p>Once one has fitted a somewhat smooth curve through scatters of observed outcomes, Y,
versus the fitted propensity scores, X, for the patients in each of the two treatment groups,
one can consider the question: "Over the range where both smooth curves are defined (i.e. their
common support), what is the (weighted) average signed difference between these two curves?"
</p>
<p>If the distribution of patients (either treated or untreated) were UNIFORM over this range, the
(unweighted) average signed difference (treated minus untreated) would be an appropriate
estimate of the overall difference in outcome due to choice of treatment.
</p>
<p>Histogram patient counts within 100 cells of width 0.01 provide a naive "non-parametric density
estimate" for the distribution of total patients (treated or untreated) along the propensity
score axis.  The weighted average difference (and standard error) displayed by SPSsmoot() are
based on an R density() smooth of these counts.
</p>
<p>In situations where the propensity scoring distribution for all patients in a therapeutic class
is known to differ from that of the patients within the current study, that population weighted
average would also be of interest.  Thus the SPSloess() output object contains two data frames,
logrid and lofit, useful in further computations.
</p>

<dl>
<dt>logrid</dt>
<dd>
<p>loess grid data.frame containing 11 variables and 100 observations. The PS
variable contains propensity score "cell means" of 0.005 to 0.995 in steps of 0.010.
Variables F0, S0 and C0 for treatment 0 and variables F1, S1 and C1 for treatment 1 contain
fitted smooth spline values, standard error estimates and patient counts, respectively.  The
DIF variable is simply (F1-F0), the SED variable is sqrt(S1*S1+S0*S0), the HST variable is
proportional to (C0+C1), and the DEN variable is the estimated probability density of patients
along the PS axis.  Observations with "NA" for variables F0, S0, F1 or S1 represent "extremes"
where the lowess fits could not be extrapolated because no observed outcomes were available.</p>
</dd>
<dt>losub0, losub1</dt>
<dd>
<p>loess fit data.frame contains 4 variables for each distinct PS value in lofit.
These 4 variables are named PS, YAVG, TRT==0 and 1, respectively, and FIT = spline prediction for
the specified degrees-of-freedom (default df=1.)</p>
