<h2>Apertures of Chupa Pots from Three Philippine Communities</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The apertures of the chupa pots from three Philippine locations: 
Dalupa (<code>ApDl</code>), Dangtalan (<code>ApDg</code>), and Paradijon (<code>ApP</code>).
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(pot)
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 343 observations of 2 variables: <code>obs</code> 
(integer values of observed apertures) 
and locations (factor with 3 levels).
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Archaeologists are concerned with the effect that increasing economic activity 
had on older civilizations. Economic growth and its related economic specialization 
led to the "standardization hypothesis", i.e., increased production of an item would 
lead to its becoming more uniform. Kvamme et al. (1996) focused 
on earthenware, chupa-pots from three Philippine communities that differ in 
the way they organize ceramic production. In Dangtalan, pottery is primarily made 
for household use; in Dalupa there is a non-market barter economy where potters 
exchange their works. In the village of Paradijon, near the provincial capital, 
full-time pottery specialists sell their output to shopkeepers for sale to 
the general public.
