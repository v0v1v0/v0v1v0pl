<h2>Dutch Cars Data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This data set relates to 187 Dutch households rating 10 automobile manufacturers according 
to 8 variables (original Dutch terms in parentheses): price (prijsniveau), design (vormgeving), safety (veiligheid), operating cost (gebruikskosten), )
sportiness (sportiviteit), size (modelgrootte), reliability (betrouwbaarheid) and feautures (uitrusting). 
A rating scale from 1 to 10 was used.
</p>

<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A three-way array with cars in the first dimension, variables in the second and 
consumers in the third dimension.

<p>The items and labels for the endpoints of the scales are (original Dutch labels in parentheses):

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The original sample consisted of 188 households. However, one of these households (code 87845) was discarded 
because it appears that they used a rating scale from 0 to 10 instead of from 1 to 10. Note that all rating scales has
been reversed so that higher scores are better for most items. The exceptions are OperatingCost and Size, where larger
values mean higher costs and smaller cars respectively.
