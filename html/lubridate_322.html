<h2>Changes the components of a date object</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>update.Date()</code> and <code>update.POSIXt()</code> return a date with the specified
elements updated.  Elements not specified will be left unaltered. update.Date
and update.POSIXt do not add the specified values to the existing date, they
substitute them for the appropriate parts of the existing date.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">## S3 method for class 'POSIXt'
update(
  object,
  ...,
  roll_dst = c("NA", "post"),
  week_start = getOption("lubridate.week.start", 7),
  roll = NULL,
  simple = NULL
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>object</code></td>

<p>a date-time object</p>
</td>

<p>is a string vector of length one or two. When two values are
supplied they specify how to roll date-times when they fall into "skipped" and
"repeated" DST transitions respectively. A single value is replicated to the
length of two. Possible values are:
</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre>* `pre` - Use the time before the transition boundary.
* `boundary` - Use the time exactly at the boundary transition.
* `post` - Use the time after the boundary transition.
* `xfirst` - crossed-first: First time which occurred when crossing the
   boundary. For addition with positive units pre interval is crossed first and
   post interval last. With negative units post interval is crossed first, pre -
   last. For subtraction the logic is reversed.
* `xlast` - crossed-last.
* `NA` - Produce NAs when the resulting time falls inside the problematic interval.
</pre></div>
<p>For example 'roll_dst = c("NA", "pre") indicates that for skiped intervals
return NA and for repeated times return the earlier time.
</p>
<p>When multiple units are supplied the meaning of "negative period" is determined by
the largest unit. For example <code>time_add(t, days = -1, hours = 2, roll_dst = "xfirst")</code> would operate as if with negative period, thus crossing the boundary
from the "post" to "pre" side and "xfirst" and hence resolving to "post"
time. As this might result in confusing behavior. See examples.
</p>
<p>"xfirst" and "xlast" make sense for addition and subtraction only. An error is
raised if an attempt is made to use them with other functions.</p>

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>a date object with the requested elements updated. The object will retain its
original class unless an element is updated which the original class does not
support. In this case, the date returned will be a POSIXlt date object.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">date &lt;- ymd("2009-02-10")
update(date, year = 2010, month = 1, mday = 1)

update(date, year = 2010, month = 13, mday = 1)

update(date, minute = 10, second = 3)
</code></pre>
