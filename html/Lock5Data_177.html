<h3>Details</h3>

<p>In the study, mice were randomly assigned to either an enriched environment where there was an exercise wheel available,
or a standard environment with no exercise options.
After three weeks in the specified environment, for five minutes a day for two weeks, the mice were each exposed to a "mouse bully" - a mouse who was very strong, aggressive, and territorial.
One measure of mouse anxiety is amount of time hiding in a dark compartment, with mice who are more anxious spending more time in darkness. The amount of time spent in darkness is recorded for each of the mice.
