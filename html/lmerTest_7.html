<h2>Consumer Preference Mapping of Carrots</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>In a consumer study 103 consumers scored their preference of 12 danish
carrot types on a scale from 1 to 7. Moreover the consumers scored the
degree of sweetness, bitterness and crispiness in the products.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The carrots were harvested in autumn 1996 and tested in march 1997. In
addition to the consumer survey, the carrot products were evaluated by
a trained panel of tasters, the sensory panel, with respect to a
number of sensory (taste, odour and texture) properties. Since usually
a high number of (correlated) properties (variables) are used, in this
case 14, it is a common procedure to use a few, often 2, combined
variables that contain as much of the information in the sensory
variables as possible. This is achieved by extracting the first two
principal components in a principal components analysis (PCA) on the
product-by-property panel average data matrix. In this data set the
variables for the first two principal components are named
(<code>sens1</code> and <code>sens2</code>).
