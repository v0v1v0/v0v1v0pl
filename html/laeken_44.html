<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The Structural Earnings Survey (SES) is conducted in almost all European
Countries, and the most important figures are reported to Eurostat.  SES is a
complex survey of enterprises and establishments with more than 10 employees,
NACE C-O, including a large sample of employees.  In many countries, a
two-stage design is used where in the first stage a stratified sample of
enterprises and establishments on NACE 1-digit level, NUTS 1 and employment
size range is used, and large enterprises have higher inclusion
probabilities.  In stage 2, systematic sampling is applied in each enterprise
using unequal inclusion probabilities regarding employment size range
categories.
</p>
<p>The data set in the package consists of enterprise and employees data from 500
places of work.  Note that this is a subset of synthetic data set that is
simulated from the original Austrian SES data.
