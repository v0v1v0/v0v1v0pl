<h2>Voting patterns in the 1933 German national election</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>1933 was the year that Hitler and the Nazi party came to power. The initial basis for this
was a national election in which the Nazis secured a substantial fraction of the vote. (Immediately
after the election, the Nazis burned the Reichtag (the German parliament) and started repressing their political
opposition though a campaign of imprisonment and murder.)
