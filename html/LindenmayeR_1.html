<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Functions to Explore L-Systems (Lindenmayer Systems)
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Lindenmayer or L-systems are parallel rewriting systems
which can be used to simulate biological forms and certain
kinds of fractals.  Briefly, in an L-system a series of
symbols in a string are replaced iteratively according to
rules to give a more complex string. Eventually, the
symbols are translated into turtle
graphics for plotting.  Wikipedia has a very good
introduction: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-system">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-system</a>
This package provides basic functions for exploring L-systems.
