<h2>Simulated data with covariates subject to limits of detection</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A simulated dataset containing a generic outcome varible and three covariates,
two of which are subject to a lower limit of detection of 0, with a sample size
of 100.  See Details for information on how these data were generated.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">lod_data_ex
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 100 rows and 4 variables:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>y</dt>
<dd>
<p>Outcome</p>
</dd>
<dt>x1</dt>
<dd>
<p>First covariate , no limits of detection</p>
</dd>
<dt>x2</dt>
<dd>
<p>Second covariate, lower limit of detection of 0</p>
</dd>
<dt>x3</dt>
<dd>
<p>Third covariate, lower limit of detection of 0</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Each of the covariates were generated independently from 100 independent draws from 
the standard normal distributon.  The outcome variable was generated from
a linear model with these three covariates, along with an intercept of 1, 
a residual variance of 1, and regression coefficients of 1 for each covariates.
Then for two of the covariates, to reflect a lower limit of detection of 0, values below 
this limit were set to 0.  This results in a 50 percent probability of being below the limit of detection for each of the 
two corresponding covariates.
