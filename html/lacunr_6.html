<h2>California oak forest stand before and after 2020 Glass Fire</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This dataset contains point cloud data from two terrestrial LiDAR scans of a
Northern California oak forest shortly before and after the Glass Fire, which
burned some 27000 hectares of land in Sonoma and Napa counties between
September 27 and October 20, 2020. The scans encompass an identical 24m by
24m rectangular plot at a study site within the Saddle Mountain Open Space
Preserve in Sonoma County.

<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">glassfire
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data table with 1,000,000 rows and 4 columns: <code>X</code>, <code>Y</code>, <code>Z</code>, and
<code>Year</code>
</p>

<dl>
<dt>
<code>X</code>,<code>Y</code>,<code>Z</code>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>The XYZ spatial positions of each point, in meters. X
and Y denote the East-West and North-South horizontal positions,
respectively, while Z denotes the vertical position</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>Year</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>The year each LiDAR scan was taken, either 2020, immediately
before the Glass Fire, or 2021, a few months after</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The original terrain topography has been removed using digital elevation
model (DEM)-based height normalization, and ground points removed by clipping
all points below 0.25m. The raw point cloud data were normalized via
voxelization at a resolution of 0.125m, and the results further down-sampled
to make the dataset more compact. The X, Y, and Z coordinates were generated
from the original Easting, Northing, and elevation by subtracting their
minimum values.

<p><code>glassfire</code> is technically encoded as a <code>lasmetrics3d</code> object from the <code>lidR</code>
package. This class inherits from <code>data.table()</code>, but has the added benefit
that it can be rendered as a 3D rgl plot using <code>lidR::plot.lasmetrics3d()</code>.
