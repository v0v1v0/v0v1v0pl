<h2>Compute error bounds for a regional frequency distribution</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>For a regional frequency distribution, the functions compute
the root mean square error (RMSE) and error bounds for quantiles
either of the regional growth curve (<code>regquantbounds</code>)
or of distributions at individual sites (<code>sitequantbounds</code>).
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">regquantbounds(relbounds, rfd)

sitequantbounds(relbounds, rfd, sitenames, index, seindex, drop = TRUE)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>relbounds</code></td>
<td>
<p>An object of class <code>"regsimq"</code>,
the result of calling function <code>regsimq</code> to simulate
relative RMSE and error bounds for a regional frequency distribution.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>rfd</code></td>
<td>
<p>An object of class <code>"rfd"</code>, containing the specification
of a regional frequency distribution.</p>
</td>

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">

(“index flood”) for the sites.</p>

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>drop</code></td>

<p>Logical: if <code>TRUE</code> and there is only one site,
the value returned from <code>sitequantbounds</code> will be an object of

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The relative RMSE values from <code>relbounds</code> are
multiplied by the quantile values from <code>rfd</code>
to yield absolute RMSE values for quantile estimates,
and the quantile values from <code>rfd</code> are divided by
the error bounds from <code>relbounds</code>
to yield error bounds for quantiles,
as in Hosking and Wallis (1997), eq. (6.19).
These computations apply to quantiles
either of the regional growth curve (for <code>regquantbounds</code>) or
of the frequency distributions at individual sites (for <code>sitequantbounds</code>).
</p>
<p>If argument <code>index</code> of <code>sitequantbounds</code> is missing,
then results (RMSE and error bounds of quantiles) are computed for sites
in the region specified by <code>rfd</code> and its <code>index</code> component,
assuming that the site-specific scale factor (“index flood”)
is estimated by the sample mean at each site, computed from the same data set
that was used to fit the regional frequency distribution.
</p>
<p>If <code>index</code> and <code>sitenames</code> are both missing, then results
will be computed for all of the sites in the region specified by <code>rfd</code>.
</p>
<p>If <code>index</code> is missing and <code>sitenames</code> is present,
then error bounds will be computed for a subset of the
sites in the region specified by <code>rfd</code>.
<code>sitenames</code> will be used to select sites from the vector <code>rfd$index</code>,
either by position or by name.
</p>
<p>If argument <code>index</code> of <code>sitequantbounds</code> is present,
then results are computed for arbitrary sites
(for example, ungauged sites for which the regional growth curve
of the regional frequency distribution <code>rfd</code> is believed to apply),
assuming that the site-specific scale factor (“index flood”)
is estimated from data that are (approximately) statistically independent
of the data used to fit the regional frequency distribution.
In this case <code>relbounds$sim.rgc</code> must not be <code>NULL</code>,
i.e. <code>relbounds</code> should have been generated by a call to
<code>regsimq</code> with argument <code>save=TRUE</code>.
</p>
<p>If <code>index</code> and <code>sitenames</code> are both present,
they must have the same length, and will be taken to refer to sites
whose names are the elements of <code>sitenames</code> and whose index-flood values
are the elements of <code>index</code>.
</p>
<p>If <code>index</code> is present and <code>sitenames</code> is missing,
results are computed for sites whose index-flood values
are the elements of <code>index</code>; if <code>index</code> has names, these
names will be used as the site names.
</p>
<p>When <code>index</code> and <code>seindex</code> are specified, it is assumed
in the simulation procedure that the estimated index flood value has a
gamma distribution with mean <code>index</code> and standard deviation <code>seindex</code>.
</p>
<p>As noted by Hosking and Wallis (1997, discussion following (6.19)),
error bounds in the lower tail of the distribution may be unhelpful
when the fitted distribution can take negative values.
In these cases the computed bounds will be
<code>NA</code> (if the quantile estimate is negative) or
<code>Inf</code> (if the quantile estimate is positive but the
corresponding error bound in <code>relbounds</code> is negative).
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>For <code>regquantbounds</code>, an object of class <code>"rfdbounds"</code>.
This is a data frame with columns
<code>f</code>, probabilities for which quantiles are estimated;
<code>qhat</code>, estimated quantiles;
<code>RMSE</code>, RMSE of the estimated quantiles.
Also, for each bound probability in <code>relbounds$boundprob</code>, there is
a column containing the error bound corresponding to that probability.
The object also has an attribute <code>"boundprob"</code> that contains the
bound probabilities.
</p>
<p>For <code>sitequantbounds</code>, a list each of whose components is
an object of class <code>"rfdbounds"</code> containing results for one site.
In this case the second column of the data frame is named <code>Qhat</code>,
not <code>qhat</code>.
If <code>drop</code> is <code>TRUE</code> and the list has one component,
a single <code>"rfdbounds"</code> object is returned.
</p>
<p>For exact definitions of quantities returned by functions
<code>regquantbounds</code> and <code>regsitebounds</code>, see vignette <code>RegSim</code>.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>For a region that is confidently believed to be homogeneous,
the region used to generate the results in <code>relbounds</code>
may be the same as that specified by <code>rfd</code>.
In practice, it is often acknowledged that some degree of heterogeneity
is present in the data to which the distribution <code>rfd</code> is fitted.
The simulations used in function <code>regsimq</code> to generate <code>relbounds</code>
can then be based on a region whose specification includes
an appropriate degree of heterogeneity, and the error bounds calculated
by <code>regquantbounds</code> and <code>sitequantbounds</code> will honestly
reflect the failure of the assumption of homogeneity
made by <code>regfit</code> (i.e. that the at-site growth curves
are the same for all sites in the region) to hold exactly.
The example below illustrates this practice.
