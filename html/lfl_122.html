<h2>Reduce the size of rule base</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>From given rule base, select such set of rules that influence mostly the
rule base coverage of the input data.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">reduce(
  x,
  rules,
  ratio,
  tnorm = c("goedel", "goguen", "lukasiewicz"),
  tconorm = c("goedel", "goguen", "lukasiewicz"),
  numThreads = 1
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>Data for the rules to be evaluated on. Could be either a numeric
matrix or numeric vector.  If matrix is given then the rules are evaluated
on rows. Each value of the vector or column of the matrix represents a
predicate - it's numeric value represents the truth values (values in the
interval <code class="reqn">[0, 1]</code>).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>rules</code></td>
<td>
<p>Either an object of class "farules" or list of character
vectors where each vector is a rule with consequent being the first element
of the vector. Elements of the vectors (predicate names) must correspond to
the <code>x</code>'s names (of columns if <code>x</code> is a matrix).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>ratio</code></td>
<td>
<p>A percentage of rule base coverage that must be preserved. It
must be a value within the <code class="reqn">[0, 1]</code> interval. Value of 1 means that the
rule base coverage of the result must be the same as coverage of input
<code>rules</code>. A sensible value is e.g. 0.9.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>tnorm</code></td>
<td>
<p>Which t-norm to use as a conjunction of antecedents. The
default is <code>"goedel"</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>tconorm</code></td>
<td>
<p>Which t-norm to use as a disjunction, i.e. to combine
multiple antecedents to get coverage of the rule base. The default is
<code>"goedel"</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>numThreads</code></td>
<td>
<p>How many threads to use for computation. Value higher than
1 causes that the algorithm runs in several parallel threads (using the
OpenMP library).</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>From a given rulebase, a rule with greatest coverage is selected. After
that, additional rules are selected that increase the rule base coverage the
most. Addition stops after the coverage exceeds <code class="reqn">original coverage *
ratio</code>.
</p>
<p>Note that the size of the resulting rule base is not necessarily minimal
because the algorithm does not search all possible combination of rules. It
only finds a local minimum of rule base size.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Function returns an instance of class <code>farules()</code> or a
list depending on the type of the <code>rules</code> argument.
