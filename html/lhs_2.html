<h2>Augment a Latin Hypercube Design</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Augments an existing Latin Hypercube Sample, adding points to the design, while
maintaining the <em>latin</em> properties of the design.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">augmentLHS(lhs, m = 1)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>lhs</code></td>
<td>
<p>The Latin Hypercube Design to which points are to be added.
Contains an existing latin hypercube design with a number of rows equal
to the points in the design (simulations) and a number of columns equal
to the number of variables (parameters).  The values of each cell must be
between 0 and 1 and uniformly distributed</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>m</code></td>
<td>
<p>The number of additional points to add to matrix <code>lhs</code></p>
</td>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Augments an existing Latin Hypercube Sample, adding points to the design, while
maintaining the <em>latin</em> properties of the design.  Augmentation is perfomed
in a random manner.
</p>
<p>The algorithm used by this function has the following steps.
First, create a new matrix to hold the candidate points after the design has
been re-partitioned into <code class="reqn">(n+m)^{2}</code> cells, where n is number of
points in the original <code>lhs</code> matrix.  Then randomly sweep through each
column (1...<code>k</code>) in the repartitioned design to find the missing cells.
For each column (variable), randomly search for an empty row, generate a
random value that fits in that row, record the value in the new matrix.
The new matrix can contain more filled cells than <code>m</code> unles <code class="reqn">m = 2n</code>,
in which case the new matrix will contain exactly <code>m</code> filled cells.
Finally, keep only the first m rows of the new matrix.  It is guaranteed to
have <code>m</code> full rows in the new matrix.  The deleted rows are partially full.
The additional candidate points are selected randomly due to the random search
for empty cells.
