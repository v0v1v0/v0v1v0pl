<h2>
Rosenwald et al. Lymphochip data
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This dataset contains 60 Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphomas analysed on Lymphochip microarrays, as published by Rosenwald et al. The "Germinal Center B-cell like" and "Activated B-Cell like" subtypes, as determined by hierarchical clustering, were predicted by a LPS approach in Wright et al.
</p>
<p>To minimize package size, values were rounded at 3 decimals and only 60 DLBCL from the 240 series were randomly selected (40 from the "Training" set, 20 from the "Validation" set), excluding "Type III" sub-types.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(rosenwald)</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p><code>rosenwald.expr</code> is a numeric matrix of expression values, with probes in rows and samples in columns. Both dimensions are named, probes by there "UNIQID" and samples by there "LYM numbers". Many <code>NA</code> values are present.
</p>
<p><code>rosenwald.cli</code> is a data.frame with a row for each sample, and 4 <code>factor</code> columns described below. Rows are named by samples "LYM numbers", in the same order than <code>rosenwald.expr</code>.
</p>

<dl>
<dt>set</dt>
<dd>
<p>the "Training" or "Validation" set the sample comes from.</p>
</dd>
<dt>group</dt>
<dd>
<p>the DLBCL sub-type that is to be predicted ("GCB" or "ABC").</p>
</dd>
<dt>follow.up</dt>
<dd>
<p>follow-up of the patient, in years.</p>
</dd>
<dt>status</dt>
<dd>
<p>status of the patient at the end of the follow-up ("Dead" or "Alive").</p>
</dd>
