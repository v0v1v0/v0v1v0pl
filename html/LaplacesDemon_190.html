<h2>Integrated Autocorrelation Time</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The <code>IAT</code> function estimates integrated autocorrelation time,
which is the computational inefficiency of a continuous chain or MCMC
sampler. IAT is also called the IACT, ACT, autocorrelation time,
autocovariance time, correlation time, or inefficiency factor. A lower
value of <code>IAT</code> is better. <code>IAT</code> is a MCMC diagnostic that is
an estimate of the number of iterations, on average, for an
independent sample to be drawn, given a continuous chain or Markov
chain. Put another way, <code>IAT</code> is the number of correlated samples
with the same variance-reducing power as one independent sample.
</p>
<p>IAT is a univariate function. A multivariate form is not included.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p><code>IAT</code> is a MCMC diagnostic that is often used to compare
continuous chains of MCMC samplers for computational inefficiency,
where the sampler with the lowest <code>IAT</code>s is the most efficient
sampler. Otherwise, chains may be compared within a model, such as
with the output of <code>LaplacesDemon</code> to learn about the
inefficiency of the continuous chain. For more information on
comparing MCMC algorithmic inefficiency, see the
<code>Juxtapose</code> function.
</p>
<p><code>IAT</code> is also estimated in the <code>PosteriorChecks</code>
function. <code>IAT</code> is usually applied to a stationary, continuous
chain after discarding burn-in iterations (see <code>burnin</code>
for more information). The <code>IAT</code> of a continuous chain correlates
with the variability of the mean of the chain, and relates to
Effective Sample Size (<code>ESS</code>) and Monte Carlo Standard
Error (<code>MCSE</code>).
</p>
<p><code>IAT</code> and <code>ESS</code> are inversely related, though not
perfectly, because each is estimated a little differently. Given
<code class="reqn">N</code> samples and taking autocorrelation into account,
<code>ESS</code> estimates a reduced number of <code class="reqn">M</code> samples.
Conversely, <code>IAT</code> estimates the number of autocorrelated samples,
on average, required to produce one independently drawn sample.
</p>
<p>The <code>IAT</code> function is similar to the <code>IAT</code> function in the
<code>Rtwalk</code> package of Christen and Fox (2010), which is currently
unavailabe on CRAN.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>The <code>IAT</code> function returns the integrated autocorrelation time of
a chain.
