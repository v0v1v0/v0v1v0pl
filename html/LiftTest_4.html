<h2>A Bootstrap Proportion Test for Brand Lift Testing (Liu et al., 2023)</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function implements several proportion tests that can be applied
to Brand Lift Testing, including
</p>

<ol>
<li> <p><code class="reqn">\mathbf{clt}</code>: Absolute lift based Z-test and relative lift based Z-test. The limiting
distribution of Z-statistics are derived from the central limit theorem.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code class="reqn">\mathbf{bootstrap}</code>: Absolute lift based bootstrap test (BS-A) and relative lift based
bootstrap test (BS-R), see Liu et al., (2023).
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code class="reqn">\mathbf{bootstrapmean}</code>: Absolute lift based bootstrap mean test and relative lift
based bootstrap mean test. (Efron and Tibshirani 1994).
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code class="reqn">\mathbf{permutation}</code>: Absolute lift based permutation test and relative lift based
permutation test. (Efron and Tibshirani 1994).
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Learn more about the proportion tests in the section Details.

<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">proportion.test(data, method, B)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>data</code></td>
<td>
<p>A 2x2 matrix with first column being (control sample size, treatment sample size)
and the 2nd column being (control positive response count, treatment positive response count).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>method</code></td>
<td>
<p>The method should be one of ("clt", "bootstrap",
"bootstrapmean", "permutation")</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>B</code></td>
<td>
<p>Number of replications for bootstrap test or permutation test.
Only required for methods "bootstrap", "bootstrapmean", "permutation".</p>
</td>
</tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p><code class="reqn">\mathbf{clt}</code>: the classic Z-test based on normal approximation. The absolute
lift based Z-test is defined as
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">
Z = \frac{\hat p_1 - \hat p_0}{\sqrt{{s_0^2}/{n_0} + {s_1^2}/{n_1}}},
</code>
</p>

<p>and he relative lift based Z-test is defined as
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">
Z_r = \frac{\hat p_1 / \hat p_0 - 1}{\sqrt{s_1^2/(n_1\hat p_0^2) + 
\hat p_1^2s_0^2/(n_0 \hat p_0^4)}},
</code>
</p>

<p>where <code class="reqn">s_0^2 = \hat p_0(1-\hat p_0)</code> and <code class="reqn">s_1^2 = \hat p_1(1-\hat p_1)</code>.
</p>
<p><code class="reqn">\mathbf{bootstrap}</code>: the bootstrap proportion tests proposed in Liu et al., (2023),
see Algorithm 1 in their paper. There are two bootstrap tests: the absolute lift
based bootstrap test BS-A and the relative lift based bootstrap test BS-R. Note that
this type of bootstrap test is testing whether the distribution of the control group is
the same as the distribution of the treatment group. In the binomial distribution case,
it is equivalent to test whether the mean of the control group is
the same as the mean of the treatment group.
</p>
<p><code class="reqn">\mathbf{bootstrapmean}</code> the bootstrap test to test whether the mean of the
control group is the same as the mean of the treatment group. See Algorithm 16.2
of Efron and Tibshirani (1994).
</p>
<p><code class="reqn">\mathbf{permutation}</code> the permutation test to test whether the distribution of the
control group is the same as the distribution of the treatment group.
See Algorithm 15.1 of Efron and Tibshirani (1994).
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A list of absolute lift, relative lift, standardized absolute lift and their corresponding
p-values. Standardized absolute lift equals absolute lift divided by its standard deviation.
Only absolute lift and relative lift are available for method clt.
