<h2>Subset a Data Frame Using Value Labels</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>slab</code> ("subset using labels") allows one to filter rows and select columns
from a data.frame based on variable-specific value label attributes.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">slab(data, condition, ...)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>data</code></td>
<td>
<p>the data.frame from which columns rows will be filtered (and,
possibly, columns selected)</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>condition</code></td>
<td>
<p>row-filtering conditions along the lines of base::subset()
and/or dplyr::filter(). Note: Row-filtering conditions (to include
condition==NULL) must be supplied. Conditions involving value-labeled
variables must be expressed in terms of the value labels (see examples),
else try <code>ssubset.</code></p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>...</code></td>
<td>
<p>Optionally supply one or more unquoted, comma-separated
column names that identify columns to be retained (Note: If no columns are
listed, all columns will be retained). Note: While row-filtering conditions
may leverage standard operators (e.g., &amp;, |, ==, !=), the column-selection
portion of call may not incorporate special characters or symbols, such as
quotes, parentheses, colons, minus signs, exclamation points, or other
operators. Only positive selection of columns is permitted (negative
selection – i.e., "select not / select-all-except" specified columns is not
supported)</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p><code>slab</code> does base::subset-style data subsetting using variable value label
meta-data that are associated with variable values but are not themselves
values (i.e., will not appear in response to <code>View()</code>, <code>head()</code>, etc.).
In other words, value labels are supplied to the <code>slab()</code> call to direct the
filtering process, but those value labels are not displayed in the cells of
the returned data.frame – the raw values themselves are. This functionality
may be useful for interactively subsetting a data.frame, where character
value labels may be more intuitive and easily recalled than the underlying
variable values themselves (e.g., raceth=="White" &amp; gender="F" may be more intuitive or
readily recalled than raceth==3 &amp; gender==2).
</p>
<p><code>slab</code>takes as its arguments a labelr value-labeled data.frame, followed by
condition-based row-filtering instructions (required) and a list of unquoted
names of variables to be retained (optional; all variables returned by
default).
</p>
<p>Note 1: When using <code>slab</code>, any conditional row-filtering syntax involving
value-labeled variables must be expressed in terms of those variables' value
labels, not the raw values themselves. Filtering on non-value-labeled
variables is also permitted, with those variables' filtering conditions being
expressed in terms of raw values. Further, <code>slab()</code> calls may reference both
types of columns (i.e., value-labeled variables and non-value-labeled
variables), provided filtering conditions for the former are expressed in
terms of value labels.
</p>
<p>Note 2: <code>slab</code> (and labelr more broadly) is intended for moderate-sized (or
smaller) data.frames, defined loosely as those with a few million or fewer
rows. With a conventional (c. 2024) laptop, labelr operations on modest-
sized (~100K rows) take seconds (or less); with larger (&gt; a few million rows)
data.frames, labelr may take several minutes (or run out of memory and fail
altogether!), depending on the complexity of the call and the number and type
of cells implicated in it.

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>a labelr label attribute-preserving data.frame consisting of the
selected rows that meet the filtering condition(s) and the columns whose
(unquoted, comma-separated) names are passed to dots (...) (or all columns
if no column names are passed).
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R"># make toy demographic (gender, raceth, etc.) data set
set.seed(555)
df &lt;- make_demo_data(n = 1000)

# let's add variable VALUE labels for variable "raceth"
df &lt;- add_val_labs(df,
  vars = "raceth", vals = c(1:7),
  labs = c("White", "Black", "Hispanic", "Asian", "AIAN", "Multi", "Other"),
  max.unique.vals = 50
)

# let's add variable VALUE labels for variable "gender"
# note that, if we are labeling a single variable, we can use add_val1()
# distinction between add_val1() and add_val_labs() will become more
# meaningful when we get to our Likert example
df &lt;- add_val1(
  data = df, gender, vals = c(0, 1, 2, 3, 4),
  labs = c("M", "F", "TR", "NB", "Diff-Term"), max.unique.vals = 50
)

# see what we did
# get_val_labs(df)
get_val_labs(df, "gender")
get_val_labs(df, "raceth")

# use --labels-- to subset w/ slab() ("*S*ubset using *lab*els")
dflab &lt;- slab(df, raceth == "Asian" &amp; gender == "F", id, gender)
head(dflab, 4)

# equivalently, use --values--- to filter w/ sfilter() ("*S*afe filter")
dfsf &lt;- ssubset(df, raceth == 3 &amp; gender == 1, gender, raceth)
head(dfsf, 4)
