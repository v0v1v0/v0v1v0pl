<h2>Conversion of Annual Nonexceedance Probability to Partial Duration Nonexceedance Probability</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function takes an annual exceedance probability and converts it to a “partial-duration series” (a term in Hydrology) nonexceedance probability through a simple assumption that the Poisson distribution is appropriate for arrive modeling. The relation between the cumulative distribution function <code class="reqn">G(x)</code> for the partial-duration series is related to the cumulative distribution function <code class="reqn">F(x)</code> of the annual series (data on an annual basis and quite common in Hydrology) by
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">G(x) = [\log(F(x)) + \eta]/\eta\mathrm{.}</code>
</p>

<p>The core assumption is that successive events in the partial-duration series can be considered as <em>independent</em>. The <code class="reqn">\eta</code> term is the arrival rate of the events. For example, suppose that 21 events have occurred in 15 years, then <code class="reqn">\eta = 21/15 = 1.4</code> events per year.
</p>
<p>A comprehensive demonstration is shown in the example for <code>fpds2f</code>. That function performs the opposite conversion. Lastly, the cross reference to <code>x2xlo</code> is made because the example contained therein provides another demonstration of partial-duration and annual series frequency analysis.
