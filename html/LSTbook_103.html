<h2>Roster of applicants to six major departments at UC Berkeley</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Roster of applicants to six major departments at UC Berkeley
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(UCB_applicants)
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data.frame object with 4236 rows, one for each of the applicants to
graduate school at UC Berkeley for the Fall 1973 quarter.
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><code>admit</code>: Whether the applicant was admitted.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>gender</code>: male or female
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>dept</code>: The graduate department applied to. Rather than identifying the actual
departments involved, the data released by Berkeley used letter codes.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>In 1973, officials at the University of California Berkeley noticed
disturbing trends in graduate admissions rates. The data, with department names redacted,
was presented and interpretted in a famous paper in <em>Science</em>, Bickel et al. 1975. In
that paper, summary tables were presented. <code>UCB_applicants</code> was reverse
engineered from <code>datasets::UCBAdmissions</code> into
a data table where the unit of observation is an individual applicant. The origin of
<code>datasets::UCBAdmissions</code> is not clear; those data are not explicitly provided in Bickel et al.
