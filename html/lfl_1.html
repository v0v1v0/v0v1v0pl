<h2>Aggregation of fired consequents into a resulting fuzzy set</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Take a character vector of consequent names, a numeric vector representing
the degree of consequents' firing and a matrix that models fuzzy sets
corresponding to the consequent names, and perform an aggregation of the
consequents into a resulting fuzzy set.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">aggregateConsequents(
  conseq,
  degrees,
  partition,
  firing = lukas.residuum,
  aggreg = pgoedel.tnorm
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>conseq</code></td>
<td>
<p>A character vector of consequents. Each value in the vector
must correspond to a name of some column of the <code>partition</code> matrix.
The length of this vector must be the same as of the <code>degrees</code>
argument.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>degrees</code></td>
<td>
<p>A numeric vector of membership degrees at which the
corresponding consequents (see the <code>conseq</code> argument) are fired.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>partition</code></td>
<td>
<p>A matrix of membership degrees that describes the meaning of
the consequents in vector <code>conseq</code>: each column of the matrix
corresponds to a fuzzy set that models a single consequent (of a name given
by column names of the matrix), each row corresponds to a single crisp
value (which is not important for this function), hence each cell
corresponds to a membership degree in which the crisp value is a member of
a fuzzy set modeling the consequent.  Each consequent in <code>conseq</code>
must correspond to some column of this matrix. Such matrix may be created
e.g. by using <code>fcut()</code> or <code>lcut()</code> functions.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>firing</code></td>
<td>
<p>A two-argument function used to compute the resulting truth value of the consequent.
Function is evaluated for each consequent in <code>conseq</code>, with corresponding <code>degrees</code> value
as the first argument and corresponding truth-value of the consequent (from <code>partition</code>)
as the second argument. In default, the Lukasiewicz residuum (<code>lukas.residuum()</code>) is
evaluated that way.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>aggreg</code></td>
<td>
<p>An aggregation function to be used to combine fuzzy sets resulting from firing
the consequents with the <code>firing</code> function. The function should accept multiple
numeric vectors of membership degrees as its arguments.
In default, the Goedel t-norm (<code>pgoedel.tnorm()</code>) is evaluated.</p>
</td>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This function is typically used within an inference mechanism, after a set of
firing rules is determined and membership degrees of their antecedents are
computed, to combine the consequents of the firing rules into a resulting
fuzzy set. The result of this function is then typically defuzzified
(see <code>defuzz()</code>) to  obtain a crisp result of the inference.
</p>
<p>Function assumes a set of rules with antecedents firing at degrees given in
<code>degrees</code> and with consequents in <code>conseq</code>. The meaning of the consequents is
modeled with fuzzy sets whose membership degree values are captured in the
<code>partition</code> matrix.
</p>
<p>With default values of <code>firing</code> and <code>aggreg</code> parameters, the function
computes a fuzzy set that results from a conjunction (Goedel minimum t-norm)
of all provided implicative (Lukasiewicz residuum) rules.
</p>
<p>In detail, the function first computes the fuzzy set of each fired consequent
by calling <code style="white-space: pre;">⁠part\[i\] &lt;- firing(degrees\[i\], partition\[, conseq\[i\]\])⁠</code> for each
<code>i</code>-th consequent and the results are aggregated using the <code>aggreg</code>
parameter: <code style="white-space: pre;">⁠aggreg(part\[1\], part\[2\], ...)⁠</code>. In order to aggregate consequents
in a Mamdani-Assilian's fashion, set <code>firing</code> to <code>pgoedel.tnorm()</code> and <code>aggreg</code>
to <code>pgoedel.tconorm()</code>.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A vector of membership degrees of fuzzy set elements that correspond
to rows in the <code>partition</code> matrix. If empty vector of consequents is
provided, vector of 1's is returned. The length of the resulting vector
equals to the number of rows of the <code>partition</code> matrix.
