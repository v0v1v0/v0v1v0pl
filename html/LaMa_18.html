<h2>Build all transition probability matrices of a periodically inhomogeneous HMM</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Given a periodically varying variable such as time of day or day of year and the associated cycle length, 
this function calculates the transition probability matrices by applying the inverse multinomial logistic link to linear predictors of the form <br><br><code class="reqn"> 
 \eta^{(t)}_{ij} = \beta_0^{(ij)} + \sum_{k=1}^K \bigl( \beta_{1k}^{(ij)} \sin(\frac{2 \pi k t}{L}) + \beta_{2k}^{(ij)} \cos(\frac{2 \pi k t}{L}) \bigr) </code> <br><br>
for the off-diagonal elements (<code class="reqn">i \neq j</code>).
This is relevant for modeling e.g. diurnal variation and the flexibility can be increased by adding smaller frequencies (i.e. increasing <code class="reqn">K</code>).
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">tpm_p(tod = 1:24, L = 24, beta, degree = 1, Z = NULL, byrow = FALSE)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>tod</code></td>
<td>
<p>Equidistant (generalized) time of day sequence, denoting the time point in a cycle.
For time of day and e.g. half-hourly data, this could be 1, ..., L and L = 48, or 0.5, 1, 1.5, ..., 24 and L = 24.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>L</code></td>
<td>
<p>Length of one full cycle, on the scale of tod</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>beta</code></td>
<td>
<p>Matrix of coefficients for the off-diagonal elements of the transition probability matrix.
Needs to be of dimension c(N*(N-1), 2*degree+1), where the first column contains the intercepts.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>degree</code></td>
<td>
<p>Degree of the trigonometric link function. For each additional degree, one sine and one cosine frequency are added.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>Z</code></td>
<td>
<p>Pre-calculated design matrix (excluding intercept column). Defaults to NULL if trigonometric link should be calculated. 
From an efficiency perspective, Z should be pre-calculated within the likelhood function, as the basis expansion should not be redundantly calculated. This can be done by using trigBasisExpansion(). <br><br>
Furthermore, Z can also be a pre-calculated design matrix from mgcv::cSplineDes() (with p columns), when one wants to use cyclic P-splines, or it can be any other basis expansion of the cyclic variable.
In that case, the dimension of beta needs to be c(N*(N-1), p+1) and a penalty term should be added at the end of the negative log-likelihood.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>byrow</code></td>
<td>
<p>Logical that indicates if each transition probability matrix should be filled by row. 
Defaults to FALSE, but should be set to TRUE if one wants to work with a matrix of beta parameters returned by popular HMM packages like moveHMM, momentuHMM, or hmmTMB.</p>

<p>Array of transition probability matrices of dimension c(N,N,length(tod))

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R"># hourly data 
tod = seq(1, 24, by = 1)
L = 24
beta = matrix(c(-1, 2, -1, -2, 1, -1), nrow = 2, byrow = TRUE)

# half-hourly data
## integer tod sequence

## equivalent specification

Gamma1-Gamma2 # same result

# cubic P-splines
set.seed(123)
nk = 8 # number of basis functions
tod = seq(0.5, 24, by = 0.5)
L = 24
k = L * 0:nk / nk # equidistant knots
Z = mgcv::cSplineDes(tod, k) ## cyclic spline design matrix
beta = matrix(c(-1, runif(8, -2, 2), # 9 parameters per off-diagonal element
                 -2, runif(8, -2, 2)), nrow = 2, byrow = TRUE)
