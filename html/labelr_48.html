<h2>Remove Name Label Attributes from a Data Frame</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Remove one or more descriptive variable name label attributes previously
added to a data.frame using <code>add_name_labs</code>.
</p>
<p>Note: <code>dnl</code> is a compact alias for <code>drop_name_labs</code>: they do the same thing,
and the former is easier to type
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">drop_name_labs(data, vars = NULL)

dnl(data, vars = NULL)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>data</code></td>
<td>
<p>the data.frame with name labels that you wish to drop (and which
were added using <code>add_name_labs</code>).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>vars</code></td>
<td>
<p>the names of the columns/variables (not the name labels) whose
name labels you wish to drop. If NULL, all variables' name labels will be
dropped.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p><code>drop_name_labs</code> works with <code>add_name_labs</code>, <code>get_name_labs</code> and
<code>use_name_labs</code> to facilitate creation, accessing, substitution, and removal
of variable name labels for variable names. Each variable (column) of a
data.frame can receive one and only one "name label," which typically is a
noun phrase that expounds the meaning or contents of the variable's name
(e.g., "Weight in ounces at birth" might be a viable name label for a column
called "wgt"). <code>drop_name_labs</code> takes a data.frame and (optionally) a
character vector of variables whose name labels should be discarded: If only
a data.frame is provided, all variable name labels will be dropped. You can
assign new name labels using new calls to <code>add_name_labs</code> (If you wish to
change some or all name labels, you do not need to call <code>drop_name_labs</code>: you
can simply pass the new name labels to <code>add_name_labs</code>, and they will
overwrite the old ones (including any automatically generated provisional
ones), while leaving in place any previously added name labels that you do
not explicitly replace).
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>The same data.frame you submitted, except that the selected name
label attribute meta-data has been removed.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R"># create a data set
df &lt;- mtcars

# variable names and their labels
names_labs_vec &lt;- c(
  "mpg" = "Miles/(US) gallon",
  "cyl" = "Number of cylinders",
  "disp" = "Displacement (cu.in.)",
  "hp" = "Gross horsepower",
  "drat" = "Rear axle ratio",
  "wt" = "Weight (1000 lbs)",
  "qsec" = "1/4 mile time",
  "vs" = "Engine (0 = V-shaped, 1 = straight)",
  "am" = "Transmission (0 = automatic, 1 = manual)",
  "gear" = "Number of forward gears",
  "carb" = "Number of carburetors"
)

# assign variable labels
df &lt;- add_name_labs(df,
  vars = names(names_labs_vec),
  labs = names_labs_vec
)

# see what we have
get_name_labs(df)

# drop the name label for var/col "am"
df &lt;- drop_name_labs(df, "am")

# see what this did to the name label for "am"
get_name_labs(df)

# now, drop all of the name labels
df &lt;- drop_name_labs(df)
get_name_labs(df) # they're gone
