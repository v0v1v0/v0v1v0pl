<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Engineers in Dresden, Germany were looking at ways to improve traffic flow by enabling
traffic lights to communicate information about traffic flow with nearby traffic lights. The data show results of one experiment where they simulated buses moving along a street and recorded the delay time (in seconds) for both a fixed time and a flexible system of lights. The process was repeated under both conditions for a sample of 24 simulated scenarios.
