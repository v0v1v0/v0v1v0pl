<h2>Summarize the results of a test of stationarity contained i
a <code>tos</code> object.
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function summarizes the results of a <code>tos</code>
object that contains information about a test of stationarity.
The summary function prints out information about how many
individual hypothesis tests there were, how many were rejected
and what the (equivalent) rejection p-value was (in the last cases
both for FDR and Bonferroni). If the hypothesis of stationarity
is rejected then the routine also prints out a list of the Haar
wavelet coefficients (and their scales, locations and scale of
the wavelet periodogram) that were significant.
The function also returns a lot of this information (invisibly).
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">## S3 method for class 'tos'
summary(object, size = 0.05, quiet = FALSE, mctype = "FDR", ...)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>object</code></td>
<td>
<p>The output from a function that carries out a test
of stationarity, e.g. <code>hwtos2</code>.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>size</code></td>
<td>
<p>The nominal overall significance level of the test.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>quiet</code></td>
<td>
<p>If this argument is <code>TRUE</code> then nothing is printed
to the screen, although the information is still returned as
an object. If <code>FALSE</code> then this function prints out
the information about the hypothesis test.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>mctype</code></td>
<td>
<p>This argument can be <code>"FDR"</code> for false discovery
rate or <code>"BON"</code> for Bonferroni. This argument does not
effect the basis printout. However, it does control whether
FDR or Bonferroni rejects are listed, and it does control
the type of information returned by the function (whether
FDR or Bonferroni info).

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>The function returns a list which contain a list of the
rejected coefficients. Each list item contains the index
of a particular rejected coefficient, which is a vector
of at least three elements. The first element corresponds to
the scale of the wavelet periodogram, the second is the level of
the Haar wavelet transform, and all remaining values are the
index of the significant wavelet coefficients at that Haar wavelet
transform scale. The list also contains the total number of
Haar wavelet coefficients rejected and the <code>mctype</code>
argument also.
