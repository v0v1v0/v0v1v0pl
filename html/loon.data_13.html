<h2>Human immunoglobulin G1 antibody molecule</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Human immunoglobulin G1 is an antibody molecule of
10,401 atoms.  The great bulk of these form residues attached
to 1,556 alpha carbons (alpha refers to the first carbon
that attaches to a functional group).
In this protein molecule, the functional groups called
residues are either amino acids or carbohydrates (sugar molecules).
</p>
<p>On the geometry of this protein, from Padlan (1994, p. 172):
"An antibody molecule is composed of three major
fragments: the two Fabs, which are identical and each
of which contains the light chain and the first two
domains of the heavy chain, and the Fc, which contains
the C-terminal constant domains of the two heavy chains.
The Fabs are linked to the Fc by the hinge
region, which varies in length and flexibility in the
different antibody classes and isotypes. The antigen binding
sites (paratopes) are located at the tips of the Fabs."
</p>
<p>Full names for amino acid residues and group characteristics
were taken from the commercial website www.tocris.com.
</p>
<p>The data records all 1,556 alpha carbons, their residues,
which of five separate chains each carbon belongs to,
and the geometric location given by coordinates
x, y, and z as determined by X-ray crystallography and as available
to Padlan (1994) either from the Protein Data Bank or or
from original investigators at the time of publication.
</p>
<p>From the source website: "It is a composite model built from F(ab)2
fragments from Brookhaven file 2IG2.PDB, and an Fc fragment from
Brookhaven file 1FC2.PDB. Part of the hinge region and other details
are theoretically modeled."

<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 1556 rows and 10 variates:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>recordType</dt>
<dd>
<p>Either 'ATOM' or 'HETATM'.
Here 'ATOM' indicates an atom having a standard residue
of the protein; 'HETATM' (hetero atom) indicates one either
having a non-standard residue of protein, or one in a group of a different kind
such as carbohydrates, substrates, ligands, solvent, or metal ions. In
the igg1 molecule, these will be a part of some carbohydrate.</p>
