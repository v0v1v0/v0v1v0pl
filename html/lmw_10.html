<h3>Details</h3>

<p><code>lmw_iv()</code> computes weights that make the weighted difference in
outcome means between the treatment groups equal to the two-stage least
squares (2SLS) estimate of the treatment effect. <code>formula</code> corresponds
to the second-stage (reduced form) model, with the treatment replaced by its
fitted values resulting from the first stage model. The first stage is fit
by replacing the treatment in the supplied <code>formula</code> with the IVs named
in <code>iv</code> and using the treatment as the outcome. The treatment is
assumed to be endogenous and the supplied instrumental variables assumed to
be instruments conditional on the other covariates, which are assumed to to
be exogenous.
</p>
<p>When any treatment-by-covariate interactions are present in <code>formula</code>
or when <code>method = "MRI"</code>, covariates are centered at specific values to
ensure the resulting weights correspond to the desired estimand as supplied
to the <code>estimand</code> argument. For the ATE, the covariates are centered at
their means in the full sample. For the ATT and ATC, the covariates are
centered at their means in the treatment or control group (i.e., the
<code>focal</code> group), respectively. For the CATE, the covariates are centered
according to the argument supplied to <code>target</code> (see below). Note that
when covariate-by-covariate interactions are present, they will be centered
after computing the interaction rather than the interaction being computed
on the centered covariates unless <code>estimand = "CATE"</code>, in which case
the covariates will be centered at the values specified in <code>target</code>
prior to involvement in interactions. Note that the resulting effect estimate
does not actually correspond to the estimand supplied unless all effect
heterogeneity is due to the included covariates.
</p>
<p>When treatment-by-covariate interactions are included in <code>formula</code>,
additional instruments will be formed as the product of the supplied IVs and
the interacting covariates. When <code>method = "MRI"</code>, instruments will be
formed as the product of the supplied IVs and each of the covariates. All
treatment-by-covariate interactions are considered endogenous.
</p>


<h4>Base weights and sampling weights</h4>

<p>Base weights (<code>base.weights</code>) and sampling weights (<code>s.weights</code>)
are similar in that they both involve combining weights with an outcome
regression model. However, they differ in a few ways. Sampling weights are
primarily used to adjust the target population; when the outcome model is
fit, it is fit using weighted least squares, and when target balance is
assessed, it is assessed using the sampling weighted population as the
target population. Centering of covariates in the outcome model is done
using the sampling weighted covariate means. Base weights are primarily used
to offer a second level of balancing beyond the implied regression weights,
i.e., to fit the 2SLS models in the base-weighted sample. Base weights do
not change the target population, so when target balance is assessed, it is
assessed using the unweighted population as the target population.
</p>
<p>Some forms of weights both change the target population and provide an extra
layer of balancing, like propensity score weights that target estimands
other than the ATT, ATC, or ATE (e.g., overlap weights), or matching weights
where the target population is defined by the matching (e.g., matching with
a caliper, cardinality matching, or coarsened exact matching). Because these
weights change the target population, they should be supplied to
<code>s.weights</code> to ensure covariates are appropriately centered. In
<code>lmw_iv()</code>, whether weights are supplied to <code>base.weights</code> or
<code>s.weights</code> will not matter for the estimation of the weights but will
affect the target population in balance assessment.
</p>
<p>When both <code>base.weights</code> and <code>s.weights</code> are supplied, e.g., when
the base weights are the result of a propensity score model fit with
sampling weights, it is assumed the base weights do not incorporate the
sampling weights; that is, it is assumed that to estimate a treatment effect
<em>without</em> regression adjustment, the base weights and the sampling
weights would have to be multiplied together. This is true, for example, for
the weights in a <code>matchit</code> or <code>weightit</code> object (see below) but
not for weights in the output of <code>MatchIt::match.data()</code> unless called
with <code>include.s.weights = FALSE</code> or weights resulting from
<code>CBPS::CBPS()</code>.
</p>



<h4>2SLS after using <span class="pkg">MatchIt</span> or <span class="pkg">WeightIt</span>
</h4>

<p>Instrumental variable regression weights can be computed in a matched or weighted sample
by supplying a <code>matchit</code> or <code>weightit</code> object (from <span class="pkg">MatchIt</span>
or <span class="pkg">WeightIt</span>, respectively) to the <code>obj</code> argument of <code>lmw()</code>.
The estimand, base weights, and sampling weights (if any) will be taken from
the supplied object and used in the calculation of the implied regression
weights, unless these have been supplied separately to <code>lmw_iv()</code>. The
<code>weights</code> component of the supplied object containing the matching or
balancing weights will be passed to <code>base.weights</code> and the
<code>s.weights</code> component will be passed to <code>s.weights</code>. Arguments
supplied to <code>lmw_iv()</code> will take precedence over the corresponding
components in the <code>obj</code> object.
</p>



<h4>Multi-category treatments</h4>

<p>Multi-category treatments are not
currently supported for <code>lmw_iv()</code>.
</p>



<h4>Fixed effects</h4>

<p>A fixed effects variable can be supplied to the
<code>fixef</code> argument. This is equivalent to adding the fixed effects
variable as an exogenous predictor that does not interact with the
treatment, IV, or any other covariate. The difference is that computation is
much faster when the fixed effect has many levels because demeaning is used
rather than including the fixed effect variable as a collection of dummy
variables. When using URI, the weights will be the same regardless of
whether the fixed effect variable is included as a covariate or supplied to
<code>fixef</code>; when using MRI, results will differ because the fixed effect
variable does not interact with treatment. The fixed effects variable will
not appear in the <code>summary.lmw()</code> output (but can be added using
<code>addlvariables</code> argument) or in the model output of <code>lmw_est()</code> or
<code>summary.lmw_est()</code>. Because it does not interact with the
treatment, the distribution of the fixed effect variable may not correspond
to the target population, so caution should be used if it is expected the
treatment effect varies across levels of this variable (in which case it
should be included as a predictor). Currently only one fixed effect variable
is allowed.
