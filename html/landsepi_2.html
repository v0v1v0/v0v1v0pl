<h2>Landscape allocation</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Generates a landscape composed of fields where croptypes
are allocated with controlled proportions and spatio-temporal aggregation.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">AgriLand(
  landscape,
  Nyears,
  rotation_period = 0,
  rotation_sequence = list(c(0, 1, 2)),
  rotation_realloc = FALSE,
  prop = list(c(1/3, 1/3, 1/3)),
  aggreg = list(1),
  algo = "periodic",
  croptype_names = c(),
  graphic = FALSE,
  outputDir = "./"
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>landscape</code></td>
<td>
<p>a spatialpolygon object containing field coordinates.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>Nyears</code></td>
<td>
<p>an integer giving the number of simulated cropping seasons.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>rotation_period</code></td>
<td>
<p>number of years before rotation of the landscape. There is no rotation if rotation_period=0 or rotation_period=Nyears.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>rotation_sequence</code></td>
<td>
<p>a list, each element of the list contains indices of croptypes that are cultivated during a period given by "rotation_period".
There is no change in cultivated croptypes if the list contains only one element (e.g. only one vector c(0,1,2), indicating cultivation of
croptypes 0, 1 and 2).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>rotation_realloc</code></td>
<td>
<p>a logical indicating if a new random allocation of croptypes is performed when the landscape is rotated
(FALSE=static allocation, TRUE=dynamic allocation). Note that if rotation_realloc=FALSE, all elements of the list "rotation_sequence"
must have the same length, and only the first element of the lists "prop" and "aggreg" will be used.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>prop</code></td>
<td>
<p>a list of the same size as "rotation_sequence", each element of the list contains a vector of the proportions (in surface)
associated with the croptypes in "rotation_sequence". A single vector can be given instead of a list if all elements of
"rotation_sequence" are associated with the same proportions.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>aggreg</code></td>
<td>
<p>a list of the same size as "rotation_sequence", each element of the list is a single double indicating the degree of
aggregation of the landscape. This double must greater or equal 0; the greater its value, the higher the degree of
spatial aggregation (roughly, aggreg between 0 and 0.1 for fragmented landscapes, between 0.1 and 0.5 for balanced
landscapes, between 0.5 and 3 for aggregated landscapes, and above 3 for highly aggregated landscapes).
A single double can be given instead of a list if all elements of
"rotation_sequence" are associated with the same level of aggregation.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>algo</code></td>
<td>
<p>the algorithm used for the computation of the variance-covariance matrix of the multivariate
normal distribution: "exp" for exponential function, "periodic" for periodic function,
"random" for random draw (see details of function multiN). If algo="random", the parameter aggreg is not used.
Algorithm "exp" is preferable for big landscapes.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>croptype_names</code></td>
<td>
<p>a vector of croptype names (for legend in graphic).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>graphic</code></td>
<td>
<p>a logical indicating if a graphic of the landscape must be generated (TRUE) or not (FALSE).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>outputDir</code></td>
<td>
<p>a directory to save graphic</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>An algorithm based on latent Gaussian fields is used to allocate two different croptypes
across the simulated landscapes (e.g. a susceptible and a resistant cultivar, denoted as
SC and RC, respectively). This algorithm allows the control of the proportions of each croptype
in terms of surface coverage, and their level of spatial aggregation.
A random vector of values is drawn from a multivariate normal distribution with expectation 0
and a variance-covariance matrix which depends on the pairwise distances between
the centroids of the fields. Next, the croptypes are allocated to different fields
depending on whether each value drawn from the multivariate normal distribution is above
or below a threshold. The proportion of each cultivar in the landscape is controlled by the value
of this threshold. To allocate more than two croptypes, <code>AgriLand</code> uses sequentially
this algorithm. For instance, the allocation of three croptypes (e.g. SC, RC1 and RC2)
is performed as follows:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p> the allocation algorithm is run once to segregate the fields where the susceptible
cultivar is grown, and
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> the two resistant cultivars (RC1 and RC2) are assigned to the remaining candidate
fields by re-running the allocation algorithm.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>a gpkg (shapefile) containing the landscape structure (i.e. coordinates of field boundaries),
the area and composition (i.e. croptypes) in time (i.e. each year) for each field. A png graphic can be generated if graphic=TRUE.
