<h2>Data for a Split-Plot ANOVA</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A study of four different pre-workout supplements analyzed their effectiveness in terms of the number of repetitions of a given exercise and weight. Each of 14 participants were randomly assigned to one of two groups: Hi quality Food, a nutritious breakfast, and Low quality Food, a less nutritious breakfast. Each group of 7 participants took all four Supplements, each in randomized order, one for each workout. The result is a total of 28 data values for each group, 56 data values overall.
</p>
<p>Type of Supplements is a within- groups treatment variable. The other treatment variable, Food quality, is a between-groups treatment variable.

<h3>Format</h3>
