<h2>Heat and Cognition</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Effect of heat on cognitive ability
</p>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 46 observations on the following 3 variables.
</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>AC</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Whether the student had air conditioning on in the room, <code>No</code> or <code>Yes</code></p>
</dd>
<dt><code>MathZRT</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Z-score of reaction time solving math problems</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>ColorsZRT</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Z-score of reaction time solving STROOP color problems</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Forty-six college students were asked to solve cognitive problems first thing in the morning during a heat wave in their Northeastern city.  Twenty of the students had air-conditioning in their rooms and twenty-six did not.  Z-scores of reaction times are given for math problems and for color dissonance problems.
