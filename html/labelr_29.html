<h2>Add or Modify Data Frame Variable Name Labels</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Add descriptive variable name labels (up to one per column) to the columns of
a data.frame.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">add_name_labs(
  data,
  name.labs = NULL,
  vars = NULL,
  labs = NULL,
  init.max = NULL
)

anl(data, name.labs = NULL, vars = NULL, labs = NULL, init.max = NULL)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>data</code></td>
<td>
<p>the data.frame you wish to begin labeling.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>name.labs</code></td>
<td>
<p>a named character vector, where names are current data.frame
column (variable) names, and where values are the proposed labels. If this is
NULL, vars and labs arguments may not be NULL. If latter are not NULL, this
(name.labs) argument must be NULL.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>vars</code></td>
<td>
<p>the names of the columns (variables) to which name labels will be
applied. If NULL, labs arg must also be NULL and name.labs cannot be NULL.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>labs</code></td>
<td>
<p>the proposed variable name labels to applied to the columns
(variables). If non-NULL, vars arg must also be non-NULL.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>init.max</code></td>
<td>
<p>If non-NULL, this must be a 1L integer, indicating the maximum
number of unique values that a variable may have for it to receive placeholder
value labels, which will consist of the variable's actual values coerced to
character values. If NULL, or if the variable is numeric with decimal values,
the variable will not be given initialized variable value labels.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Note: <code>anl</code> is a compact alias for <code>add_name_labs</code>: they do the same thing,
and the former is easier to type.
</p>
<p><code>add_name_labs</code> works with <code>get_name_labs</code>, <code>use_name_labs</code>, and
<code>use_var_names</code> to facilitate the creation, accessing, and substitution of
variable name labels for variable names.
</p>
<p>Each variable (column) of a data.frame can receive one and only one "name
label," which typically is a noun phrase that expounds the meaning of
contents of the variable's name (e.g., "Weight in ounces at birth" might be a
name label for a column called "wgt"). <code>add_name_labs </code>takes a data.frame and
either a named character vector (names are current variable names, values are
proposed name labels) supplied to the name.labs arg or two separate character
vectors (one each for current variable names and proposed variable name
labels, respectively) supplied to vars and labs args, respectively. If using
the second approach, the order of each entry matters (e.g., the first
variable name entry to the vars argument will be given the label of the first
name label entry to the labs argument, and so on).
</p>
<p>Note that any non-name-labeled columns will receive their own names as
default name labels (e.g., if var "mpg" of mtcars is not assigned a name
label, it will be given the default name label of "mpg"). Note also that
other labelr functions (e.g., <code>add_val_labs</code>) will initialize name labels
and other labelr attribute meta-data in this same fashion. Name labels can
be removed with <code>drop_name_labs</code>.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A data.frame, with new name labels added (call <code>get_name_labs</code> to
see them), other provisional/default labelr label information added, and
previous user-added labelr label information preserved.
</p>
