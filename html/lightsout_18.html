<h2>Solve a Lights Out board</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Given a Lights Out board, find the set of lights that need to be pressed in
order to solve the board. If no solution is possible, an error is thrown.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">solve_board(board)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>board</code></td>
<td>
<p>A <code>lightsout</code> board object.</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>There are a few algorithms for solving Lights Out puzzles. This function
implements the Gaussian Elimination technique, which does not guarantee
the minimum number of steps. Therefore, some steps in the given solution
may be redundant.
</p>
<p>If you are interested, there are many resources online outlining the exact
details of how this technique works, and what the other solving strategies are.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A matrix with the same dimensions as the input board, with a <code>1</code>
in every position that requires a press to solve to the board. Note that the
order of the light presses does not matter.
