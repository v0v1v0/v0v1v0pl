<h2>Data from National Supported Work Demonstration and PSID, as analyzed by
Dehejia and Wahba (1999).</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This is a subsample of the data from the treated group in the National
Supported Work Demonstration (NSW) and the comparison sample from the
Population Survey of Income Dynamics (PSID). This data was previously
analyzed extensively by Lalonde (1986) and Dehejia and Wahba (1999). The
original dataset is available at
<a href="https://users.nber.org/~rdehejia/nswdata2.html">https://users.nber.org/~rdehejia/nswdata2.html</a>.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">lalonde
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 2675 observations (185 treated, 2490 control). There
are 9 variables measured for each individual. In addition, two constructed variables are included: <code>treat_multi</code>, which splits the original control group into two, and <code>Ins</code>, which is a constructed instrumental variable.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> "treat" is the
treatment assignment (1=treated, 0=control).
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> "age" is age in years.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> "education" is education in number of years of schooling.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> "race" is
the individual's race/ethnicity, (Black, Hispanic, or White).
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> "married" is an indicator for married (1=married, 0=not married).
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> "nodegree" is an indicator for whether the individual lacks a high school
degree (i.e., has fewer than 12 years of schooling; 1=no degree, 0=degree).
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> "re74" is income in 1974, in U.S. dollars.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> "re75" is income in
1975, in U.S. dollars.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> "re78" is income in 1978, in U.S. dollars.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> "treat_multi" is a constructed version of "treat" that splits the control group into to levels (1=treated, 2=control group A, 3=control group B).
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> "Ins" is a binary instrumental variable.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>"treat" is the treatment variable, "re78" is the outcome, and the others are
pre-treatment covariates. Note that in the original data, "race" is instead
coded as two dummy variables, "black" and "hispan".
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The data corresponds to the NSW treated sample and the PSID control sample
with 1974 earnings included. This specific dataset is different from the one in the
<span class="pkg">MatchIt</span> and <span class="pkg">cobalt</span> packages, which is a subset of this dataset.
