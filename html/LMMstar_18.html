<h2>Data From The Calcium Supplements Study (Wide Format)</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Data from a randomized study including 112 girls at age 11 investigate the effect of a calcium supplement (n=55) vs. placebo (n=57)
on bone mineral density over a 2 year follow-up. The clinical question is: does a calcium supplement help to increase bone gain in adolescent women?
This dataset is in the wide format (i.e. one line per patient).
