<h2>Truncated Stick-Breaking</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The <code>Stick</code> function provides the utility of truncated
stick-breaking regarding the vector
<code class="reqn">\theta</code>. Stick-breaking is commonly referred to as a
stick-breaking process, and is used often in a Dirichlet
process (Sethuraman, 1994). It is commonly associated with
infinite-dimensional mixtures, but in practice, the ‘infinite’ number
is truncated to a finite number, since it is impossible to estimate an
infinite number of parameters (Ishwaran and James, 2001).
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">Stick(theta)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>theta</code></td>
<td>
<p>This required argument, <code class="reqn">\theta</code> is a vector
of length <code class="reqn">(M-1)</code> regarding <code class="reqn">M</code> mixture components.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The Dirichlet process (DP) is a stochastic process used in Bayesian
nonparametric modeling, most commonly in DP mixture models, otherwise
known as infinite mixture models. A DP is a distribution over
distributions. Each draw from a DP is itself a discrete
distribution. A DP is an infinite-dimensional generalization of
Dirichlet distributions. It is called a DP because it has
Dirichlet-distributed, finite-dimensional, marginal distributions,
just as the Gaussian process has Gaussian-distributed,
finite-dimensional, marginal distributions. Distributions drawn from a
DP cannot be described using a finite number of parameters, thus the
classification as a nonparametric model. The truncated stick-breaking
(TSB) process is associated with a truncated Dirichlet process (TDP).
</p>
<p>An example of a TSB process is cluster analysis, where the number of
clusters is unknown and treated as mixture components. In such a
model, the TSB process calculates probability vector <code class="reqn">\pi</code>
from <code class="reqn">\theta</code>, given a user-specified maximum number of
clusters to explore as <code class="reqn">C</code>, where <code class="reqn">C</code> is the length of
<code class="reqn">\theta + 1</code>. Vector <code class="reqn">\pi</code> is assigned a TSB
prior distribution (for more information, see <code>dStick</code>).
</p>
<p>Elsewhere, each element of <code class="reqn">\theta</code> is constrained to the
interval (0,1), and the original TSB form is beta-distributed with the
<code class="reqn">\alpha</code> parameter of the beta distribution constrained
to 1 (Ishwaran and James, 2001). The <code class="reqn">\beta</code> hyperparameter
in the beta distribution is usually gamma-distributed.
</p>
<p>A larger value for a given <code class="reqn">\theta_m</code> is associated
with a higher probability of the associated mixture component,
however, the proportion changes according to the position of the
element in the <code class="reqn">\theta</code> vector.
</p>
<p>A variety of stick-breaking processes exist. For example, rather than
each <code class="reqn">\theta</code> being beta-distributed, there have been other
forms introduced such as logistic and probit, among others.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>The <code>Stick</code> function returns a probability vector wherein each
element relates to a mixture component.
