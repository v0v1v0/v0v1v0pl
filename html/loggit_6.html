<h2>Log entries to file</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function executes immediately before the function definitions for the
base handler functions (message, warning,
and stop, and logs their timestamped output (a bit more
verbosely) to a log file. The log file is an
<a href="https://github.com/ndjson">ndjson</a> file, which is a portable, JSON-based
format that is easily parsed by many line-processing systems.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">loggit(log_lvl, log_msg, ..., echo = TRUE, custom_log_lvl = FALSE, sanitizer)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>log_lvl</code></td>
<td>
<p>Level of log output. In actual practice, one of "DEBUG",
"INFO", "WARN", and "ERROR" are common, but any string may be supplied if
<code>custom_log_lvl</code> is TRUE. Will be coerced to class <code>character</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>log_msg</code></td>
<td>
<p>Main log message. Will be coerced to class <code>character</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>...</code></td>
<td>
<p>A named <code>list</code> or named <code>vector</code> (each element of length one) of
other custom fields you wish to log. You do not need to explicitly provide
these fields as a formal list or vector, as shown in the example; R handles
the coercion.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>echo</code></td>
<td>
<p>Should the log file entry be printed to the console as well?
Defaults to <code>TRUE</code>, and will print out the <code>ndjson</code> line to be logged. This
argument is passed as <code>FALSE</code> when called from <code>loggit</code>'s handlers, since
they still call base R's handlers at the end of execution, all of which
print to the console as well.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>custom_log_lvl</code></td>
<td>
<p>Allow log levels other than "DEBUG", "INFO", "WARN",
and "ERROR"? Defaults to <code>FALSE</code>, to prevent possible typos by the
developer, and to limit the variation in structured log contents. Overall,
setting this to 'TRUEâ€œ is not recommended, but is an option for
consistency with other frameworks the user may work with.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>sanitizer</code></td>
<td>
<p>Sanitizer function to run over elements in log data. The
default sanitizer, if not specified, is <code>default_ndjson_sanitizer()</code>. See
the sanitizers documentation for information on how to write your own
(un)sanitizer functions.</p>

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">  loggit("INFO", "This is a message", but_maybe = "you want more fields?",
  sure = "why not?", like = 2, or = 10, what = "ever")

</code></pre>
