<h2>Diabetes Data from Andrews and Herzberg</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Data  on 145 non-obese patients collected at the Stanford Clinical Reseach Center to investigate "the relationship between
chemical subclinical and overt nonketotic diabetes.  The three primary variables used in the analysis and  presented [here] are glucose intolerance, insulin response
to oral glucose, and insulin resistance."
</p>
<p>From Andrews and Herzberg (1985) book called "Data". See reference.

<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 145 rows and 6 variables
</p>

<dl>
<dt>RelativeWeight</dt>
<dd>
<p>The relative weight of the patient.</p>
</dd>
<dt>FastingPlasmaGlucose</dt>
<dd>
<p>The fasting plasma glucose level.</p>
</dd>
<dt>GlucoseArea</dt>
<dd>
<p>This is a measurement of the glucose intolerance as measured by the area under the straightline
connecting glucose levels determined from blood samples drawn during a three hour
glucose tolerance test following an oral administration of a glucose load.</p>
</dd>
<dt>InsulinArea</dt>
<dd>
<p>This is a measurement of the insulin response
to oral glucose as measured by the area under the straightline
connecting insulin levels, again determined from blood samples drawn during a three hour
glucose tolerance test following an oral administration of a glucose load.</p>
</dd>
<dt>SSPG</dt>
<dd>
<p>The steady state plasma glucose (SSPG) determined  after chemical suppression 
of endogenous insulin secretion. This is a measure of insulin resistance.</p>
</dd>
<dt>ClinClass</dt>
<dd>
<p>Clinical classification of each patient, by the contemporary (1979) medical criteria,
into one of three groups: "Overt" diabetic,  "Chemical" diabetic, or  "Normal". </p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The row order of the values match the "Patient Number" given in the source table.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This is a dataset from the "Data" book by Andrews and Herzberg (1985) Chapter 36, pp. 215-220  Table 36.1
</p>
<p>A more complete description can be found there. An extract from the source follows.
</p>
<p>The purpose of the data was to investigate
</p>
<p>"the relationship between chemical subclinical
and overt nonketotic diabetes in 145 non-obese
adult subjects.
The three primary variables used in the analysis and
presented [here] are glucose intolerance, insulin response
to oral glucose, and insulin resistance.  The first two
[of these] variables are the areas under the straightline
connecting glucose and insulin levels, respectively,
determined from blood samples drawn during a three hour
glucose tolerance test following an oral administration
of a glucose load. [These are variables GlucoseArea and
InsulinArea, respectively.] Insulin resistance is measured
by the steady state plasma glucose (SSPG) determined
afterchemical suppression of endogenous insulin secretion.
In addition, the relative weight and fasting plasma
glucose were measured for each individual at the Stanford
Clinical Reseach Center and are included [here]"
</p>
<p>Each row of diabetes is a patient, and the row number
is the "Patient Number" from Andrews and Herzberg.
