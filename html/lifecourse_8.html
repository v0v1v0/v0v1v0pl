<h2>
non standardization test
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Allows the user to test a dataset of observed sequences to 
determine the probability that these sequences could have arisen due to chance.  Acknowledgements: CPC St Andrews/Edinburgh.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">nonStanTest(lifecourseSequences, sequenceUnits)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>lifecourseSequences</code></td>
<td>

<p>A dataset (matrix form) consisting of sequences.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>sequenceUnits</code></td>
<td>

<p>A vector containing the possible sequence states.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This is an approach to answering the question of whether
or not the observed sequences for a given set of lifecourses
could have arisen due to chance.  This is achieved by comparing the observed sequences to a set of randomly simulated sequences .For each observed sequence A,  there is a corresponding simulated sequence, B.   B is constructed by assigning at random, an order to the observed states in A.  The simulated sequences serve as a null distribution for the test.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A p value (LeftTailed_pval) representing the probability that the observed test statistic (corresponding to the observed data) is greater than those obtained under the null hypothesis.
A p value (RightTailed_pval) representing the probability that the observed test statistic (corresponding to the observed data) is less than those obtained under the null hypothesis.
</p>
<p>The test statistics obtained under the null hypothesis are also provided.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">
data(mydata) 
# obtaining the in-built data derived from BHPS data.
bbc = mydata
bbcseq = bbc[,2:14]   
# removing the first column which contains the ID for the persons involved.
balphabet =c("non-mover","mover within gb")   
#nll = nonStanTest(bbcseq,balphabet) 
# obtaining the null distribution and p values
