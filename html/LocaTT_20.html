<h2>Truncate DNA Sequences at Specified Probability that All Bases were Called Correctly</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Calculates the cumulative probability that all bases were called correctly along each DNA sequence and truncates the DNA sequence immediately prior to the first occurrence of a probability being equal to or less than a specified value.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">truncate_sequences.probability(sequences, quality_scores, threshold = 0.5)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>sequences</code></td>
<td>
<p>A character vector of DNA sequences to truncate.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>quality_scores</code></td>
<td>
<p>A character vector of DNA sequence quality scores encoded in Sanger format.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>threshold</code></td>
<td>
<p>Numeric. The probability threshold used for truncation. The default is <code>0.5</code> (<em>i.e.</em>, each trimmed sequence has a greater than 50% probability that all bases were called correctly).</p>
</td>
</tr>

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A list containing two elements. The first element is a character vector of truncated DNA sequences, and the second element is a character vector of quality scores which have been truncated to their corresponding truncated DNA sequences.
</p>
