<h2>Set paths to LattE and 4ti2 executables</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>These functions set the path to external programs either by (1) passing them
a character string or (2) using <code>file.choose()</code>.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">set_latte_path(path)

set_4ti2_path(path)

get_4ti2_path()

get_latte_path()

has_4ti2()

has_latte()

missing_4ti2_stop()

missing_latte_stop()
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>path</code></td>
<td>
<p>A character string, the path to a 4ti2 function (e.g. markov) for
setting 4ti2's path or a LattE function (e.g. count) for LattE's path</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>When latte is loaded it attempts to find LattE and 4ti2 executables
(represented by count and markov, respectively).  How it looks depends on
your operating system.
</p>
<p>If you're using a Mac or Linux machine, it looks based on your system's path.
Unfortunately, R changes the system path in such a way that the path that R
sees is not the same as the path that you'd see if you were working in the
terminal. (You can open the Terminal app on a Mac by going to
/Applications/Utilities/Terminal.)  Consequently, latte tries to guess the
file in which your path is set.  To do so, it first checks if your home
directory (type echo ~/ in the terminal to figure out which directory this is
if you don't know) for the file named .bash_profile.  If this file is
present, it runs it and then checks your system's path variable (echo $PATH).
If it's not present, it does the same for .bashrc and then .profile. In any
case, once it has its best guess at your path, it looks for "latte".
</p>
<p>On Windows, latte just uses <code>Sys.which()</code> on "whereis" to On Windows, latte
just uses <code>Sys.which()</code> on "whereis" to determine where the executables count
and markov are (for LattE and 4ti2, respectively).
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>An invisible character string, the path found.  More importantly, the
function has the side effect of setting the option "latte_path" or
"4ti2_path"

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">

has_4ti2()
if (has_4ti2()) get_4ti2_path()

has_latte()
if (has_4ti2()) get_latte_path()

# these are stored in your .Renviron file; that's where you should put the 
# path to LattE and 4ti2 executables. for example, you should have a lines 
# that look like
# LATTE=/Applications/latte/bin
# 4TI2=/Applications/latte/bin
# you can set these with usethis::edit_r_environ() 

# you can change these in your current session with set_latte_path() and 
# set_4ti2_path(), for example set_4ti2_path("/path/to/4ti2")
