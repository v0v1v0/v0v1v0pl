<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Data on the biomass (Mg/ha) of dominant forest species from several sample plots (sites)
in Alaska, each sampled over several years.  Original data taken from the Cooperative Alaska
Forest Inventory website.
</p>
<p>From website:
</p>
<p>"The Cooperative Alaska Forest Inventory (CAFI) is a comprehensive database of boreal 
forest conditions and dynamics in Alaska. The CAFI consists of field-gathered information
from numerous permanent sample plots distributed across interior and south-central Alaska 
including the Kenai Peninsula. 
The CAFI currently has 570 permanent sample plots on 190 sites representing a wide variety 
of growing conditions. New plots are being added to the inventory annually. (...)
Repeated periodic inventories on CAFI permanent sample plots provide valuable long-term 
information for modeling of forest dynamics such as growth and yield. 
Periodic remeasurements can also be used to test and monitor large-scale environmental 
and climate change."
