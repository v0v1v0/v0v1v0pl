<h2>Data from the trial of serial killer Kristen Gilbert</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Intensive care unit nurse <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristen_Gilbert">Kristen Gilbert</a> worked
for several years in the 1990s at a Veterans Administration Hospital.
Her co-workers became suspicious. The co-workers observed that unexpected
patient deaths occurred more frequently on her shifts than on other shifts.
They also noticed a shortage of supplies
of the cardiac stimulant epinephrine, which can be fatal
when administered in large enough doses through an IV drip. The hospital
investigators went through all the shifts during the years Gilbert
worked at the hospital, noting whether Gilbert was on duty during
that shift and whether there was a death during the shift.
