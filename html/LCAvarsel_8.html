<h2>Variable selection for latent class analysis</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Perform variable selection for latent class analysis for multivariate categorical data clustering. The function allows to find the set of variables with relevant clustering information and discard those that are redundant and/or not informative. Different searching methods can be used: stepwise backward or forward, swap-stepwise backward or forward, and stochastic evolutionary search via genetic algorithm. Concomitant covariates can be also included in the estimation of the latent class analysis model.</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">LCAvarsel(Y, G = 1:3, X = NULL,
          search = c("backward", "forward", "ga"),
          independence = FALSE, 
          swap = FALSE,
          bicDiff = 0,
          ctrlLCA = controlLCA(), 
          ctrlReg = controlReg(), 
          ctrlGA = controlGA(),
          start = NULL,
          checkG = TRUE,
          parallel = FALSE, 
          verbose = interactive())

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This function implements variable selection methods for latent class analysis for model-based clustering of multivariate categorical data. The general framework is based on a model-selection approach where the usefulness for clustering of a variable is assessed by comparing different models: a model where the variable contains relevant clustering information versus a model where it does not and it is redundant or not informative.
</p>
<p>The model selection task corresponds to a combinatorial optimization problem and to conduct the search over the models space the following methods are available:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><em>Stepwise backward/forward</em>. Enabled when <code>search = "backward"</code>. The algorithm starts from a model with all the variables included in the clustering set, then at each step a variable is removed/added until there is no further modification to the set of selected variables. At the start of the variable selection procedure, two consecutive removal steps are performed if <code>start = NULL</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><em>Stepwise forward/backward</em>. Enabled when <code>search = "forward"</code>. The algorithm  starts from the minimum subset of variables that allows a latent class analysis model to be identified, then the variables are added/removed in turn to/from the set of clustering variables until no further change to the set of selected ones. The initial set of clustering variables is chosen by default using the strategy described in Dean and Raftery (2010); however, argument <code>start</code> can be used to provide an alternative set of initial clustering variables.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><em>Swap-stepwise backward/forward</em>. Enabled when <code>search = "backward"</code> and <code>swap = TRUE</code>. In this case, an additional swap move is performed after each removal and addition step.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><em>Swap-stepwise forward/backward</em>. Enabled when <code>search = "forward"</code> and <code>swap = TRUE</code>. In this case, an extra swap move is performed after each addition and removal step.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><em>Stochastic evolutionary search</em>. Enabled when <code>search = "ga"</code>. A genetic algorithm with binary encoding is employed to search for the optimal set of clustering variables. The algorithm stops when the maximum number of iterations specified by <code>maxiter</code> has been reached or there are no further improvement in the fitness function after <code>run</code> iterations; see <code>controlGA</code>.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In the swapping step, a non-clustering variable is switched with a clustering one. The couple of variables to be swapped is selected according to their evidence of being or not being useful for clustering. This step can prevent the algorithm from getting trapped into a local sub-optimum when many correlated variables are present; however, it increases the computational cost of the variable selection procedure. 
</p>
<p>By default, at each step the variable selection procedure considers only latent class analysis models for which the identifiability condition described in <code>maxG</code> holds. When performing stepwise or swap-stepwise selection, for some combinations of clustering variables and number of classes, it could happen that a step of the variable selection procedure could not be performed because no latent class model is identifiable on any of the possible clustering sets. In such case, the step is not performed and a NA is returned. In the case of evolutionary search, non identifiable models are automatically discarded. When <code>checkG = FALSE</code>, also non identifiable models are estimated and considered during the variable selection process. Note that in this case the final output could be unreliable.
</p>
<p>The stochastic evolutionary search implemented via the genetic algorithm allows for a better exploration of the model space. During the search, multiple sets of clustering variables are considered at the same time; then, for each set, a latent class analysis model is estimated on the clustering variables and a regression/independence model is estimated on the non-clustering ones. Different sets are generated by various genetic operators and the fittest individuals are selected. The fitness function is defined as the BIC of the joint distribution of both clustering and non-clustering variables, where clustering variables are modeled via a latent class analysis model and non-clustering variables are modeled via multinomial logistic regression or simple independent multinomial distributions in the case <code>independence = TRUE</code>. The nature of the genetic algorithm leads to a more exhaustive search, however with a larger computational cost than standard stepwise selection methods. The use of the <code>parallel</code> option allows for the estimation of multiple models in parallel and can speed up the computations.
</p>
<p>If provided, the vector/matrix of concomitant covariates given in input in <code>X</code> is included in the latent class analysis model for the clustering variables at each step of the variable selection process. Thus, formally, a "latent class regression" model is estimated on the clustering variables (see <code>fitLCA</code>). Note that these covariates are only used to predict the class membership probabilities and no selection is performed on them.
