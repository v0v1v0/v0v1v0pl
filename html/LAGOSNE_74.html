<h2>Metadata for all lakes &gt; 1ha</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A dataset containing identifying information for all lakes &gt; 1ha. This includes
lake name, lake size (area and perimeter), location (lat/long), elevation,
and codes identifying zones in which the lake is located.
</p>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 141265 observations of 17 variables:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> lagoslakeid: unique identifier for each lake in LAGOS-NE.
For each row of data in this table, the lagoslakeid identifies the focal lake
for which other measures are calculated
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> nhdid: the 'Permanent_identifier' from the NHD,
but is called the NHDID in LAGOS-NE
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> gnis_name: lake name from the GNIS database
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> nhd_lat: latitude of centroid of the NHD lake polygon in decimal
degrees (NAD83)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> nhd_long: longitude of centroid of the NHD lake polygon in decimal
degrees (NAD83)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> lake_area_ha: surface area (in hectares) of lake waterbody polygon from NHD
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> lake_perim_meters: perimeter (in meters) of lake waterbody polygon from the NHD
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> nhd_fcode: NHD five-digit integer code with feature code plus additional
characteristics/values
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> nhd_ftype: NHD three-digit integer code providing a unique identifier of feature
type for the waterbody
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> iws_zoneid: the  unique ID of the IWS that is estimated for the focal lake
in the row of data that is identified by the lagoslakeid.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> hu4_zoneid: the unique ID of the HU4 zone that the focal lake is located within
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> hu6_zoneid: the unique ID of the HU6 zone that the focal lake is located within
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> hu8_zoneid: the unique ID of the HU8 zone that the focal lake is located within
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> hu12_zoneid: the unique ID of the HU12 zone that the focal lake is located within
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> edu_zoneid: the unique ID of the EDU zone that the focal lake is located within
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> county_zoneid: the unique ID of the county that the focal lake is located within
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> state_zoneid: the unique ID of the state that the focal lake is located within
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> elevation_m: the elevation of the lake centroid, in meters (referenced to the
North American Vertical Datum of 1988 (NAVD88)) and obtained from the National Elevation Dataset
</p>
</li>
</ul>
