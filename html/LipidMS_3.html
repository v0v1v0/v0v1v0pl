<h3>Details</h3>

<p>First, peak partitions are created based on the enviPick algorithm 
to speed up the following clustering algorithm. Briefly, peaks are ordered 
increasingly by mz and RT and grouped based on user-defined tolerances (dmz 
and drt). Each peak is initialized as a partition and then, they are 
evaluated to decide whether or not they can be joined to the previous 
partition. If mz and RT of a peak matches tolerance of any of the peaks in 
the previous partition, it is reassigned. Then, clustering algorithm is 
executed to group peaks based on their RT following the next steps for each 
partition:
</p>
<p>1.	Each peak in the partition is initialized as a new cluster. For each 
cluster we will keep the minimum, maximum and mean value of the RT, which at 
this point have the same values.
2.	Calculate a distance matrix between all clusters. This distance will be 
the greatest difference between minimum and maximum values of each cluster. 
Distances between clusters which share peaks from the same samples will be 
set to NA.
3.	While any distance is different to NA, search the minimum distance between 
two clusters.
4.	If distance is below the maximum distance allowed, join clusters and 
update minimum, maximum and mean values, else, set distance to NA and go back 
to point 3.
</p>
<p>Then, clusters with a sample representation over minsamples or minsamplesfrac, 
will be used for alignment. To this end, an RT matrix is built containing the 
RT of the peaks for each sample from the selected clusters. Then, median RT 
is calculated for each cluster and an RT deviation matrix is obtained. Finally, 
time drifts for each sample are corrected using loess regression by 
constructing a function based on RT deviation and median.
