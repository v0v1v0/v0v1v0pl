<h2>Fluoxetine data set</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Twenty rats were given fluoxetine and tested in the
forced swim test (FST).
</p>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 20 rows and 2 variables:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>dose:</dt>
<dd>
<p>Dose of fluoxetine (0, 80, 160, or 240 mg/L).</p>
</dd>
<dt>time.immob:</dt>
<dd>
<p>Total immobility time in the FST (seconds).</p>
</dd> </dl>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Twenty rats were randomly assigned to a control condition
or three doses of fluoxetine. Fluoxetine was administered in the
drinking water. The amount of time the rats were immobile in the
FST was measured and greater immobility time implies a more
depressive phenotype.
