<h3>Details</h3>

<p>From the source:  (May 28, 2020: health.gov.nz) 
"The case definition has been amended to de-couple respiratory symptoms 
from a history of travel. Testing is available to people with respiratory 
symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 infection (including the acute onset of 
cough with or without fever). This is regardless of travel history or 
known contact with a confirmed or probable case of COVID-19. 
Priority groups for testing have been included in the case definitions."
</p>
<p>"Confirmed case:
</p>
<p>"A case that has laboratory definitive evidence. 
Laboratory definitive evidence requires at least one of the following:
* detection of SARS-CoV-2 from a clinical specimen using a validated NAAT (PCR)
* detection of coronavirus from a clinical specimen using pan-coronavirus NAAT (PCR) and confirmation as SARS-CoV-2 by sequencing
* significant rise in IgG antibody level to SARS-CoV-2 between paired sera (when serological testing becomes available)."
