<h2>Event Coverage</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Returns the intervals over which the number of events is always one or greater.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">event_coverage(e, closed = TRUE)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>e</code></td>
<td>
<p>An event table.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>closed</code></td>
<td>
<p>Logical value indicating whether events should be interpreted as closed intervals. If <code>TRUE</code>, coverage is continuous at breaks between two adjacent events.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>If <code>closed = TRUE</code>, breaks between adjacent events are dropped. If <code>closed = FALSE</code>, breaks between adjacent events are retained, including point events on line event endpoints. Duplicate points are dropped in both cases.
</p>


<h3>See Also</h3>

<p><code>event_gaps</code> for gaps (the inverse of coverage), <code>event_range</code> for range (coverage with gaps ignored).
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">e &lt;- events(c(1, 2, 4, 8), c(3, 4, 5, 10))
event_coverage(e, closed = TRUE)  # retains breaks
event_coverage(e, closed = FALSE) # drops breaks
e &lt;- events(c(0, 2, 2, 2, 8, 10), c(0, 2, 2, 6, 10, 10))
event_coverage(e, closed = TRUE)  # retains isolated points
event_coverage(e, closed = FALSE) # retains isolated points and points adjacent to lines
</code></pre>
