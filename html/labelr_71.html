<h2>Determine Which Pattern Elements of One Character Vector Are Found in at
Least One Element of A Second Character Vector</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>greml</code> takes two character vectors of strings and, for each pattern
represented by an element of the first vector, searches all elements of the
second vector to see if any of those elements of the second vector matches
that pattern element of the first vector.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">greml(patterns, x, ignore.case = TRUE, vals = FALSE)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>patterns</code></td>
<td>
<p>a character vector of comma-separated, quoted character
strings or regular expressions.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>a character vector that will be tested for presence/absence of
the patterns passed via the patterns argument.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>ignore.case</code></td>
<td>
<p>search in a non-case-sensitive fashion if TRUE.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>vals</code></td>
<td>
<p>by default, vals = FALSE and will return a named vector that
indicates, for each unique element of patterns, whether a match for that
pattern was found somewhere in the x vector (one named logical element
returned for each patterns argument vector element). If TRUE, vals returns the
unique values of patterns that were matched (one character element for each
matched patterns argument vector element).</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This function accepts a character vector of text substring patterns or
regular expressions (patterns argument), and searches a second character
vector (x argument) to determine which elements of the first vector
(patterns) match at least one element anywhere in the second vector (x). If
vals = TRUE (default is FALSE), each matched pattern element is returned; if
vals = FALSE, a vector of named logical values equal in length to the
object supplied to the patterns argument is returned, indicating for each
patterns element whether a match for it was found anywhere in x (TRUE if so,
FALSE if not), with the names corresponding to the elements of the patterns
vector. If ignore.case = TRUE (the default), neither vector is treated case-
sensitively (both are coerced to lower-case before other operations occur).
</p>
<p>Used internally by various labelr functions (e.g., <code>use_val_labs</code>). Note that
this is the same search and syntax that is performed by <code>gremlr()</code>
(<code>gremlr</code> means "<code>greml</code> in reverse"), except that, whereas <code>greml</code> returns
matches in terms of the patterns argument (i.e., which patterns elements
match at least one x element), <code>gremlr</code> returns matches in terms of the x
argument.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>a vector, either character (if vals = TRUE) or logical (if vals =
FALSE).
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R"># search for "AB" (case-sensitively) anywhere in subsequent vector
greml(c("AB"), c("ab", "ab", "abc", "z"), vals = TRUE, ignore.case = FALSE)
# character(0)

# search for "AB" (non-case-sensitively; the default) anywhere in next vector
greml(c("AB"), c("ab", "ab", "abc", "z"), vals = TRUE, ignore.case = TRUE)
# [1] "AB"

# other searches
greml(c("AB"), c("ab", "ab", "abc", "z"), vals = TRUE, ignore.case = FALSE)
greml(c("ab"), c("ab", "ab", "abc", "z"), vals = FALSE)
greml(c("ab", "Q"), c("ab", "ab", "abc", "z"), vals = FALSE)
greml(c("a|b", "Q"), c("a", "b", "abc", "z"), vals = FALSE)
greml(c("a|b", "Q"), c("a", "b", "z"), vals = FALSE)
greml(c("a|b", "Q"), c("bq", "z"), vals = FALSE)
greml(c("a|b", "Q"), c("bq", "z"), vals = TRUE)

# compare greml (above) to gremlr() (here)
gremlr(c("AB"), c("ab", "ab", "abc", "z"), vals = TRUE, ignore.case = FALSE)
gremlr(c("ab"), c("ab", "ab", "abc", "z"), vals = FALSE)
gremlr(c("ab", "Q"), c("ab", "ab", "abc", "z"), vals = FALSE)
gremlr(c("a|b", "Q"), c("a", "b", "abc", "z"), vals = FALSE)
gremlr(c("a|b", "Q"), c("a", "b", "z"), vals = FALSE)
gremlr(c("a|b", "Q"), c("bq", "z"), vals = FALSE)
