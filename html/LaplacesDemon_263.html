<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The largest single factor to affect the run-time of an algorithm –
whether it is with <code>IterativeQuadrature</code>,
<code>LaplaceApproximation</code>, <code>LaplacesDemon</code>,
<code>PMC</code>, or <code>VariationalBayes</code> – is the time
that it takes to evaluate the model specification. This has also been
observed in Rosenthal (2007). It is highly recommended that a user of
the <code>LaplacesDemon</code> package should attempt to reduce the run-time
of the model specification, usually by testing alternate forms of code
for speed. This is especially true with big data, such as with the
<code>BigData</code> function.
</p>
<p>Every function in the LaplacesDemon package is byte-compiled, which is
a recent option in R. This reduces run-time, thanks to Tierney's
compiler package in base R. The model specification, however, is
specified by the user, and should be byte-compiled. The reduction in
run-time may range from mild to dramatic, depending on the model. It
is highly recommended that users concerned with run-time activate the
compiler package and use the <code>cmpfun</code> function, as per the
example below.
</p>
<p>A model specification function that is optimized for speed and
involves many records may result in a model update run-time that is
considerably less than other popular MCMC-based software algorithms
that loop through records, even when those algorithms are coded in
<code>C</code> or other fast languages. For a comparison, see the
“Laplace's Demon Tutorial” vignette.
</p>
<p>However, if a model specification function in the LaplacesDemon
package is not fully vectorized (contains <code>for</code> loops and
<code>apply</code> functions), then run-time will typically be slower than
other popular MCMC-based software algorithms.
</p>
<p>The speed of calculating the model specification function is
affected by parameter constraints, such as with the
<code>interval</code> function. Parameter constraints may add
considerable variability to the speed of this calculation, and usually
more variation occurs with initial values that are far from the target
distributions.
</p>
<p>Distributions in the <code>LaplacesDemon</code> package usually have logical
checks to ensure correctness. These checks may slow the 
calculation of the density, for example. If the user is confident
these checks are unnecessary for their model, then the user may
copy the code to a new function name and comment-out the checks to
improve speed.
</p>
<p>When speed is of paramount importance, a user is encouraged to
experiment with writing the model specification function in another
language such as in <code>C++</code> with the <code>Rcpp</code> package, and
calling drop-in replacement functions from within the <code>Model</code>
function, or re-writing the model function entirely in <code>C++</code>.
For an introduction to including <code>C++</code> in <span class="pkg">LaplacesDemon</span>,
see <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150227225556/http://www.bayesian-inference.com/softwarearticlescppsugar">https://web.archive.org/web/20150227225556/http://www.bayesian-inference.com/softwarearticlescppsugar</a>.
</p>
<p>When a model specification function is computationally expensive,
another approach to reduce run-time may be for the user to write
parallelized code within the model, splitting up difficult tasks and
assigning each to a separate CPU.
</p>
<p>Another use for <code>Model.Spec.Time</code> is to allow the user to make an
informed decision about which MCMC algorithm to select, given the
speed of their model specification. For example, the Adaptive
Metropolis-within-Gibbs (AMWG) of Roberts and Rosenthal (2009) is
currently the adaptive MCMC algorithm of choice in general in many
cases, but this choice is conditional on run-time. While other
MCMC algorithms in <code>LaplacesDemon</code> evaluate the model
specification function once per iteration, componentwise algorithms
such as in the MWG family evaluate it once per parameter per
iteration, significantly increasing run-time per iteration in large
models. The <code>Model.Spec.Time</code> function may forewarn the user of
the associated run-time, and if it should be decided to go with an
alternate MCMC algorithm, such as AMM, in which each element of its
covariance matrix must stabilize for the chains to become
stationary. AMM, for example, will require many more iterations of 
burn-in (for more information, see the <code>burnin</code> function),
but with numerous iterations, allows more thinning. A general
recommendation may be to use AMWG when
<code>Componentwise.Iters.per.Minute</code> &gt;= 1000, but this is subjective
and best determined by each user for each model. A better decision may
be made by comparing MCMC algorithms with the <code>Juxtapose</code>
function for a particular model.
</p>
<p>Following are a few common suggestions for increasing the speed of
<code>R</code> code in the model specification function. There are often
exceptions to these suggestions, so case-by-case experimentation is
also suggested.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> Replace exponents with multiplied terms, such as <code>x^2</code>
with <code>x*x</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Replace <code>mean(x)</code> with <code>sum(x)/length(x)</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Replace parentheses (when possible) with curly brackets, such
as <code>x*(a+b)</code> with <code>x*{a+b}</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Replace <code>tcrossprod(Data$X, t(beta))</code> with
<code>Data$X %*% beta</code> when there are few predictors, and avoid
<code>tcrossprod(beta, Data$X)</code>, which is always slowest.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Vectorize functions and eliminate <code>apply</code> and <code>for</code>
functions. There are often specialized functions. For example,
<code>max.col(X)</code> is faster than <code>apply(X, 1, which.max)</code>.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>When seeking speed, things to consider beyond the LaplacesDemon
package are the Basic Linear Algebra System (BLAS) and hardware. The
ATLAS (Automatically Tuned Linear Algebra System) should be worth
installing (and there are several alternatives), but this discussion
is beyond the scope of this documentation. Lastly, the speed at which
the computer can process iterations is limited by its hardware, and
more should be considered than merely the CPU (Central Processing
Unit). Again, though, this is beyond the scope of this documentation.

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>The <code>Model.Spec.Time</code> function returns a list with three
components:
</p>
<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>Time</code></td>
<td>
<p>This is the time in minutes to evaluate the model
specification <code>n</code> times.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>Evals.per.Minute</code></td>
<td>
<p>This is the number of evaluations of the
model specification per minute: <code>n</code> / <code>Time</code>. This is also
the number of iterations per minute in an algorithm that is not
componentwise, where one evaluation occurs per iteration.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>Componentwise.Iters.per.Minute</code></td>
<td>
<p>This is the number of iterations
per minute in a componentwise MCMC algorithm, such as AMWG or
MWG. It is the evaluations per minute divided by the number of
parameters, since an evaluation must occur for each parameter, for
each iteration.</p>
