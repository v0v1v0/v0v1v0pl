<h2>Return a D2Amat list object style name.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function returns a character string according to a particular format for naming D2Amat objects.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">A2name(J, filter.number, family, switch = "direction")</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>J</code></td>
<td>
<p>Discrete autocorrelation wavelets will be computed for scales -1 up to scale J. This number should be a negative integer.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>filter.number</code></td>
<td>
<p>The index number of the wavelet used to build the PsiJ/PhiJ object.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>family</code></td>
<td>
<p>The wavelet family used to build the PhiJIE object.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>switch</code></td>
<td>
<p>Allows the user to define how they wish their inner product matrix to be formed. There are two available options:
<code>switch = "direction"</code> - structures the matrix by scale within each 
decomposition direction. Thus, the ordering goes as follows (-1, V), (-2, V), ...
<code>switch = "scale"</code> - structures the matrix by direction within each 
scale.  Thus the ordering is as follows (-1,V), (-1, H), (-1, D), (-2, V),(-2, H), ... </p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Some of the matrices computed by D2Amat take a long time to compute. Hence it is a good idea to store and re-use them. This function generates a name according to a particular naming scheme that permits a search algorithm to easily find the matrices.
Each matrix has three defining characteristics: its order, filter.number, family and the method of construction of the matrix (switch="direction" or "level"). Each of these characteristics are concatenated together to form a name.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A character string containing the name of a matrix according to a particular naming scheme.
