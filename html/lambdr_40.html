<h2>Start the Lambda runtime</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This is the main function of the package, responsible for starting the
infinite loop of listening for new invocations. It relies on configuration
provided to the <code>config</code> argument and produced by the
<code>lambda_config</code> function.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">start_lambda(
  config = lambda_config(environ = parent.frame()),
  timeout_seconds = NULL
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>config</code></td>
<td>
<p>A list of configuration values as created by the
<code>lambda_config</code> function.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>timeout_seconds</code></td>
<td>
<p>If set, the function will stop listening for events
after this timeout. The timeout is checked between events, so this won't
interrupt the function while it is waiting for a new event. This argument
is provided for testing purposes, and shouldn't otherwise need to be set:
AWS should handle the shutdown of idle Lambda instances.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>See <code>vignette("lambda-runtime-in-container", package = "lambdr")</code> for an
example of how to use this function to place an R Lambda Runtime in a
container.
</p>
<p>This package uses the <code>logger</code> package for logging.
Debug log entries can be enabled with <code>logger::log_threshold(logger::DEBUG)</code>.
This will log additional information such as raw event bodies.
</p>


<h3>Event context</h3>

<p>Context is metadata associated with each invocation. If the handler function
accepts a <code>context</code> argument then it will automatically receive at runtime a
named list consisting of these values along with the arguments in the body
(if any). For example, a function such as <code>my_func(x, context)</code> will receive
the context argument automatically. The <code>context</code> argument must be named
(<code>...</code> will not work).
</p>
<p>Refer to <code>vignette("lambda-runtime-in-container", package = "lambdr")</code>
for details.
</p>


<h3>AWS Lambda variables</h3>

<p>The <code>lambda_config</code> function obtains the configuration values
for the Lambda runtime configures the R session for Lambda based on
environment variables made available by Lambda. The following environment
variables are available:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> Lambda Runtime API, available as the "AWS_LAMBDA_RUNTIME_API" environment
variable, is the host of the various HTTP endpoints through which the
runtime interacts with Lambda.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Lambda Task Root, available as the "LAMBDA_TASK_ROOT" environment variable,
defines the path to the Lambda function code. It isn't used in container
environments with a custom runtime, as that runtime is responsible for
finding and sourcing the function code. Hence, a missing task root is
ignored by this package.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> The handler, available as the "_HANDLER" environment variable, is
interpreted by R as the function that is executed when the Lambda is
called. This value could be anything, as the interpretation is solely up
to the runtime, so requiring it to be a function is a standard imposed by
this package.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These <code>handler</code>, <code>runtime_api</code> and <code>task_root</code> arguments to the
<code>lambda_config</code> function can also provide values to these
configuration options, although the environment variables will always be
used if available. While it may be sensible to provide the <code>handler</code>
function directly, the other two configuration options are only provided for
debugging and testing purposes.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">## Not run: 
# A general usage pattern involves sourcing necessary functions and running
# this `start_lambda` in a `runtime.R` file which is then executed to start
# the runtime. In the following example, the function handler can be set to
# "lambda" either as the container `CMD`, or configured through AWS Lambda.

parity &lt;- function(number) {
  list(parity = if (as.integer(number) %% 2 == 0) "even" else "odd")
}

start_lambda()

# Alternatively, it can be passed as an argument `handler = parity` to
# the lambda configuration. If the handler is configured through other means
# then this will be ignored:

start_lambda(config = lambda_config(handler = parity))

## End(Not run)
