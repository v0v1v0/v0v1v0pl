<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The <code>wideToLong</code> function is the companion function to <code>longToWide</code>.
The <code>data</code> argument is a "wide form" data frame, in which each row corresponds to
a single experimental unit (e.g., a single subject).  The output is a "long form" data
frame, in which each row corresponds to a single observation.
</p>
<p>The <code>wideToLong</code> function relies on the variable names to determine how the data
should be reshaped. The naming scheme for these variables places the name of the
measured variable first, followed by the levels of the within-subjects variable(s),
separated by the separator string <code>sep</code> (default is <code>_</code>) The separator
string cannot appear anywhere else in the variable names: variables without
the separator string are assumed to be between-subject variables.
</p>
<p>If the experiment measured the <code>accuracy</code> of participants at some task
at two different points in time, then the wide form data frame would contain
variables of the form <code>accuracy_t1</code> and <code>accuracy_t2</code>. After
reshaping, the long form data frame would contain one measured variable
called <code>accuracy</code>, and a within-subjects factor with levels <code>t1</code>
and <code>t2</code>. The name of the within-subjects factor is the <code>within</code>
argument.
</p>
<p>The function supports experimental designs with multiple within-subjects
factors and multi-variable observations. For example, suppose each
experimental subject is tested in two <code>conditions</code> (<code>cond1</code> and
<code>cond2</code>), on each of two <code>days</code> (<code>day1</code> and <code>day2</code>),
yielding an experimental design in which four observations are made for
each subject. For each such observation, we record the mean response time
<code>MRT</code> for and proportion of correct responses <code>PC</code> for the
participant.  The variable names needed for a design such as this one would
be <code>MRT_cond1_day1</code>, <code>MRT_cond1_day2</code>, <code>PC_cond1_day1</code>, etc.
The <code>within</code> argument should be a vector of names for the
within-subject factors: in this case, <code>within = c("condition","day")</code>.
</p>
<p>By default, if there are multiple within-subject factors implied by the
existence of multiple separators, the output will keep these as distinct
variables in the long form data frame (<code>split=FALSE</code>). If
<code>split=TRUE</code>, the within-subject factors will be collapsed into a
single variable.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R"># Outcome measure is mean response time (MRT), measured in two conditions
# with 4 participants. All participants participate in both conditions.

wide &lt;- data.frame( accuracy_t1 = c( .15,.50,.78,.55 ),  # accuracy at time point 1
                    accuracy_t2 = c( .55,.32,.99,.60 ),  # accuracy at time point 2
                    id = 1:4 )                           # id variable

# convert to long form
wideToLong( wide, "time" )


# A more complex design with multiple within-subject factors. Again, we have only
# four participants, but now we have two different outcome measures, mean response
# time (MRT) and the proportion of correct responses (PC). Additionally, we have two
# different repeated measures variables. As before, we have the experimental condition
# (cond1, cond2), but this time each participant does both conditions on two different
# days (day1, day2). Finally, we have multiple between-subject variables too, namely
# id and gender.

wide2 &lt;- data.frame( id = 1:4,
                     gender = factor( c("male","male","female","female") ),
                     MRT_cond1_day1 = c( 415,500,478,550 ),
                     MRT_cond2_day1 = c( 455,532,499,602 ),
                     MRT_cond1_day2 = c( 400,490,468,502 ),
                     MRT_cond2_day2 = c( 450,518,474,588 ),
                     PC_cond1_day1 = c( 79,83,91,75 ),
                     PC_cond2_day1 = c( 82,86,90,78 ),
                     PC_cond1_day2 = c( 88,92,98,89 ),
                     PC_cond2_day2 = c( 93,97,100,95 ) )

# conversion to long form:
wideToLong( wide2 )
wideToLong( wide2, within = c("condition","day") )

# treat "condition x day" as a single repeated measures variable:
wideToLong( wide2, split = FALSE)
