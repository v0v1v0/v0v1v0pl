<h2>Plot samples from the output of Laplace's Demon</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This may be used to plot, or save plots of, samples in an object of
class <code>demonoid</code> or <code>demonoid.hpc</code>. Plots include a trace
plot, density plot, autocorrelation or ACF plot, and if an adaptive
algorithm was used, the absolute difference in the proposal variance,
or the value of epsilon, across adaptations.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">## S3 method for class 'demonoid'
plot(x, BurnIn=0, Data, PDF=FALSE, Parms, FileName, ...)
## S3 method for class 'demonoid.hpc'
plot(x, BurnIn=0, Data, PDF=FALSE, Parms, FileName, ...)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>

<p>This required argument is an object of class <code>demonoid</code> or
<code>demonoid.hpc</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>BurnIn</code></td>
<td>

<p>This argument requires zero or a positive integer that indicates the
number of thinned samples to discard as burn-in for the purposes of
plotting. For more information on burn-in, see <code>burnin</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>Data</code></td>
<td>

<p>This required argument must receive the list of data that was
supplied to <code>LaplacesDemon</code> to create the object of
class <code>demonoid</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>PDF</code></td>
<td>

<p>This logical argument indicates whether or not the user wants
Laplace's Demon to save the plots as a .pdf file.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>Parms</code></td>
<td>

<p>This argument accepts a vector of quoted strings to be matched for
selecting parameters for plotting. This argument defaults to
<code>NULL</code> and selects every parameter for plotting. Each quoted
string is matched to one or more parameter names with the
<code>grep</code> function. For example, if the user specifies
<code>Parms=c("eta", "tau")</code>, and if the parameter names
are beta[1], beta[2], eta[1], eta[2], and tau, then all parameters
will be selected, because the string <code>eta</code> is within
<code>beta</code>. Since <code>grep</code> is used, string matching uses
regular expressions, so beware of meta-characters, though these are
acceptable: ".", "[", and "]".</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>FileName</code></td>
<td>

<p>This argument accepts a string and save the plot under the specified name. If <code>PDF=FALSE</code> this argument in unused. By default, <code>FileName = paste0("laplacesDemon-plot_", format(Sys.time(), "yyyy-mm-dd_h:m:s"), ".pdf")</code>
</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The plots are arranged in a <code class="reqn">3 \times 3</code> matrix. Each row
represents a parameter, the deviance, or a monitored variable. The
left column displays trace plots, the middle column displays kernel
density plots, and the right column displays autocorrelation (ACF)
plots.
</p>
<p>Trace plots show the thinned history of the chain or Markov chain,
with its value in the y-axis moving by thinned sample across the x-axis.
A chain or Markov chain with good properties does not suggest a trend
upward or downward as it progresses across the x-axis (it should
appear stationary), and it should mix well, meaning it should appear
as though random samples are being taken each time from the same
target distribution. Visual inspection of a trace plot cannot
verify convergence, but apparent non-stationarity or poor mixing can
certainly suggest non-convergence. A red, smoothed line also appears
to aid visual inspection.
</p>
<p>Kernel density plots depict the marginal posterior distribution.
Although there is no distributional assumption about this density,
kernel density estimation uses Gaussian basis functions.
</p>
<p>Autocorrelation plots show the autocorrelation or serial correlation
between values of thinned samples at nearby thinned samples. Samples with
autocorrelation do not violate any assumption, but are inefficient
because they reduce the effective sample size (<code>ESS</code>), and
indicate that the chain is not mixing well, since each value is
influenced by values that are previous and nearby. The x-axis
indicates lags with respect to thinned samples, and the y-axis
represents autocorrelation. The ideal autocorrelation plot shows
perfect correlation at zero lag, and quickly falls to zero
autocorrelation for all other lags.
</p>
<p>If an adaptive algorithm was used, then the distribution of absolute
differences in the proposal variances, or the value of epsilon, is
plotted across adaptations. The proposal variance, or epsilon, should
change less as the adaptive algorithm approaches the target
distributions. The absolute differences in the proposal variance plot
should approach zero. This is called the condition of diminishing
adaptation. If it is not approaching zero, then consider using a
different adaptive MCMC algorithm. The following quantiles are plotted
for absolute changes proposal variance: 0.025, 0.500, and 0.975.
