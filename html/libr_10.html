<h2>Create a data library</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A data library is a collection of data sets. The purpose of 
the data library is to combine related data sets, and provides the opportunity
to manipulate all of them as a single object. A data library is created using 
the <code>libname</code> function. The <code>libname</code> function allows you to 
load an entire directory of data into memory in one step.  The <strong>libr</strong>
package contains additional functions to add and remove data from the library, 
copy the library, and write any changed data to the file system.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">libname(
  name,
  directory_path,
  engine = "rds",
  read_only = FALSE,
  env = parent.frame(),
  import_specs = NULL,
  filter = NULL,
  standard_eval = FALSE,
  quiet = FALSE,
  log = TRUE,
  where = NULL
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>name</code></td>
<td>
<p>The unquoted name of the library to create.  The library name will 
be created as a variable in the environment specified on the <code>env</code>
parameter.  The default environment is the parent frame. If you want
to pass the library name as a quoted string or a variable, 
set the <code>standard_eval</code> parameter to TRUE to turn off the
non-standard evaluation.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>directory_path</code></td>
<td>
<p>A directory path to associate with the library.  If 
the directory contains data files of the type specified on the 
<code>engine</code> parameter, they will be imported into the library list.  If
the directory does not contains data sets of the appropriate type, 
it will be created as an empty library. If the directory does not exist, 
it will be created by the <code>libname</code> function.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>engine</code></td>
<td>
<p>The engine to associate with the library.  The specified 
engine will be used to import and export data.  The engine name 
corresponds to the standard file extension of the data file type. The
default engine is 'rds'.
Valid values are 'rds', 'Rdata', 'rda', 'sas7bdat', 'xpt', 'xls', 'xlsx', 
'dbf', and 'csv'.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>read_only</code></td>
<td>
<p>Whether the library should be created as read-only.
Default is FALSE.  If TRUE, the user will be restricted from
appending, removing, or writing any data from memory to the file system.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>env</code></td>
<td>
<p>The environment to use for the libname. 
Default is <code>parent.frame()</code>.  When working inside a function, the 
<code>parent.frame()</code> will refer to the local function scope.  When
working outside a function, the <code>parent.frame()</code> will be the
global environment. If the <code>env</code> parameter is set to a custom 
environment, the custom environment will be used for all subsequent 
operations with that libname.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>import_specs</code></td>
<td>
<p>A collection of import specifications, 
defined using the <code>specs</code> function.
The import specs should be named according to the file names in 
the library directory. See the <code>specs</code> function for additional
information.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>filter</code></td>
<td>
<p>One or more quoted strings to use as filters for the incoming 
file names. For more than one filter string, pass them as a vector of
strings. The filter string can be a full or partial file name, without
extension.  If using a partial file name, use a wild-card character (*) 
to identify the missing portion. The match will be case-insensitive.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>standard_eval</code></td>
<td>
<p>A TRUE or FALSE value which indicates whether to 
use standard (quoted) or non-standard (unquoted) evaluation on the library
<code>name</code> parameter. Use standard evaluation when you want to pass
the library name with a variable.  Default is FALSE.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>quiet</code></td>
<td>
<p>When TRUE, minimizes output to the console when loading 
files.  Default is FALSE.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>log</code></td>
<td>
<p>Whether to log the libname operation.  Default is TRUE. This
parameter is used internally.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>where</code></td>
<td>
<p>An expression used to subset all datasets in the library.
The where clause will be executed when the library is created.  Use the 
Base R <code>expression</code> function to define the subset.  If a where clause
is supplied, the library will be opened read-only.</p>
</td>
</tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>For most projects, a data file does not exist in isolation.  There are sets of 
related files of the same file type.  The aim of the <code>libname</code> function
is to take advantage of this fact, and give you an easy way to manage
the entire set.
</p>
<p>The <code>libname</code> function points to a directory of data files, and associates
a name with that set of data.  The name refers to an object of class 'lib', 
which at its heart is a named list.  When the <code>libname</code> function 
executes, it will load all the data in the directory into the list, and assign
the file name (without extension) as the list item name. Data can be accessed
using list syntax, or loaded directly into the local environment using the 
<code>lib_load</code> function.
</p>
<p>The <code>libname</code> function provides several data engines to read
data of different types.  For example, there is an engine for Excel 
files, and another engine for SAS® datasets.  The engines are identified
by the extension of the file type they handle.  The available engines are 
'rds', 'RData', 'rda', 'csv', 'xlsx', 'xls', 'sas7bdat', 'xpt', and 'dbf'.
Once an engine has been assigned to a library, all other read/write 
operations will be performed by that engine.  
</p>
<p>The data engines largely hide file import details from you.  
The purpose of the <code>libname</code> function is to make it easy to 
import a set of related data files that follow standard conventions.  
The function assumes that the 
data has file extensions that match the file type, and then makes further
assumptions based on each type of file.  As a result, there are very few 
import options on the <code>libname</code> function.  If your data does not
follow standard conventions, it is recommended that you import your 
data using a package that gives you more control over import options.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>The library object, with all data files loaded into the library
list.  Items in the list will be named according the the file name,
minus the file extension.
</p>


<h3>Data Engines</h3>

<p>The <code>libname</code> function currently provides seven different engines for 
seven different types of data files.
Here is a complete list of available engines and some commentary about each:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>rds</strong>: For R data sets.  This engine is the default.  Because
detailed data type and attribute information can be stored inside the rds
file, the rds engine is the most reliable and easiest to use.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Rdata</strong> and <strong>rda</strong>: Older R data storage formats.  
Like the 'rds' engine,
these storage types retain column attributes and data types.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>csv</strong>: For comma separated value files.  This engine assumes
that the first row has column names, and that strings containing commas are 
quoted.  Blank values and the string 'NA' will be interpreted as NA.
Because data type information is not stored in csv files, the 
csv engine will attempt to guess the data types based on the available data.
For most columns, the csv engine is able to guess accurately. Where
it fails most commonly is with date and time columns. For csv date and time
columns, it is therefore recommended to assign an import spec that tells
the engine how to read the date or time. See the <code>specs</code>
documentation for additional details.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>xlsx</strong>: For Excel files produced with the current version 
of Excel.  Excel provides more data type information than csv, but it 
is not as accurate as rds.  Therefore, you may also need to provide 
import specifications with Excel files. Also note that currently 
the xlsx import engine will only import the first sheet of an Excel workbook.  
If you need to import a sheet that is not the first sheet, use a 
different package to import the data.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>xls</strong>: An Excel file format used between 1997 and 2003, and 
still used in some organizations. As with xlsx, this file format provides more 
information than csv, but is not entirely reliable. Therefore, you may need 
to provide import specifications to the xls engine. Also note that the xls
engine can read, but not write xls files.  Any xls files read with the
xls engine will be written as an xlsx file. Like the xlsx engine, the xls
engine can only read the first sheet of a workbook.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>sas7bdat</strong>: Handles SAS® datasets. SAS® datasets provide better
type information than either csv or Excel.  In most cases, you will not 
need to define import specifications for SAS® datasets.  The sas7bdat engine
interprets empty strings, single blanks, and a single dot (".") as missing
values. While the import of SAS® datasets is fairly reliable, sas7bdat files 
cannot be written or exported with the sas7bdat engine.
In these cases, it is recommended to export to another file format, such
as csv or dbf, and then import into SAS®.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>xpt</strong>: The SAS® transport file engine.  Transport format is 
a platform independent file format.  Similar to SAS® datasets, it 
provides data type information.  In most cases, you will not need to 
define import specifications.  The xpt engine also interprets empty strings, 
single blanks, and a single dot (".") as missing values.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>dbf</strong>: The DBASE file format engine.  The DBASE engine
was added to the <strong>libr</strong> package because many types of software can
read and write in DBASE format reliably.  Therefore it is a useful 
file format for interchange between software systems.  The DBASE file 
format contains type information.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>File Filters</h3>

<p>If you wish to import only a portion of your data files into a library, 
you may accomplish it with the <code>filter</code> parameter.  The filter 
parameter allows you to pass a vector of strings corresponding to the 
names of the files you want to import.  The function allows a 
wild-card (*) for partial matching.  For example, <code>"te*"</code> means any
file name that that begins with a "te", and <code>"*st"</code> means any file name
that ends with an "st".
</p>


<h3>Import Specifications</h3>

<p>In most cases, it is not necessary to specify the data types for incoming
columns in your data.  Either the file format will preserve the appropriate
data type information, or the assigned engine will guess correctly.  
</p>
<p>However, in some cases it will be necessary to control the column data types.
For these cases, use the  
<code>import_specs</code> parameter.  The <code>import_specs</code> parameter allows you
to specify the data types by data set and column name. All the data type
specifications are contained within a <code>specs</code> collection, and the 
specifications for a particular data set are defined by an 
<code>import_spec</code> function. See the <code>specs</code> and 
<code>import_spec</code> documentation for further information
and examples of defining an import spec.
