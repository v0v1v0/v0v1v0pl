<h2>Tumor-cell resistance to death</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Artificial dataset. The experiment consists in measure the resistance to death of two types of tumor-cells over different doses of a experimental drug. The data was created considering a null intercept and a cubic polinomial for the dose.
</p>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>This data frame contains the following columns:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>dose</dt>
<dd>
<p>Quantity of dose of an experimental drug.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>type</dt>
<dd>
<p>Type of tumor-cell. Type A and B.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>score</dt>
<dd>
<p>Bounded response between 0 and 4.
</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This dataset was generated in order to be fitted with a logistic quantile regression since the response is bounded.
