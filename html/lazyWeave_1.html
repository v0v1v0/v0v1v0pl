<h2>Generate Latex or HTML reports from R</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Arguments passed to functions are embedded in Latex code and can
be output to a file.  Allows the use of Latex and HTML to write reports, functions
for building tables, etc.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Depending on the working directory (for Windows users), the user may encounter the error 
"texi2dvi.exe: Windows API error 5: Access is denied." when trying
to build documents.  This happens when the working directory is write protected.  It is advisable to change the working directory to 
something not write protected.  This can be done permanently by right clicking on the R shortcut icon, selecting properties, and changing
the directory in the "Start in:" box.
</p>
<p><code>lazyWeave</code> assumes the availability of the packages <code>xcolor, graphicx, colortbl, soul, lscape,</code> and <code>Sweave</code>.  
If these packages are not available, the package most likely will not function properly.
</p>
<p>It should be noted that <code>lazyWeave</code> is a rather inefficient way to go 
about writing reports with LaTeX or HTML.  It's only real advantage is it reduces the
amount of knowledge a user needs to have about LaTeX (and it could be 
debated if that's really an advantage).
</p>
<p>Use of <code>lazyWeave</code> could also be greatly supplemented by some basic
familiarity with LaTeX.  For example, knowing the commands for bolding 
(\textbf{}), italicizing (\emph{}), and underlining text 
(\ul{}) can go a long way to improving the look of reports.  It also would
help to know how to subscript and superscript terms.  Most introductions
to LaTeX will cover these basics.
</p>
<p><code>lazyWeave</code> is also only intended to provide the most basic functionality
of LaTeX, and I have no plans of extending it much further than what is 
available already.  If what is in the package now is not sufficient enough 
to satisfy your needs, then I strongly suggest you look into using 
<code>Sweave</code>.
</p>
<p>All of the functions can be used for LaTeX and HTML reports, but the functionality and appearance
may not be identical between formats.
