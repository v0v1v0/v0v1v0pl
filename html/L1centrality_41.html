<h2>Republic of Korea's 21st National Assembly Bill Cosponsorship Network</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Network between 317 members of the Republic of Korea's 21st National
Assembly (May 30th, 2020–May 29th, 2024). Each member of the assembly
represents one vertex.
</p>
<p>An edge between two members is formed if there is at least one cosponsored
bill. The weight of this edge is given as 1/(number of cosponsored bills
between two members) during the first 40 months of the 21st assembly (Jun.
2020–Sep. 2023).
</p>

<h3>Format</h3>

<p>An undirected, connected, and (edge) weighted <code>igraph</code> graph
object with 317 vertices and 47,657 edges.
</p>
<p>Vertex attributes:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p>‘name’: Pseudonyms of each member. They are in the format of
the party's initial character, followed by a random number (e.g., D4). Each

</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li> <p>‘party’: Factor with 7 levels. Denotes the political party of
each member as of Sep. 2023. Note that independent members are assigned to
their original party.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p>‘gender’: Factor with 2 levels. ‘M’ (male) or ‘F’
(female).
</p>
</li>
<li> <p>‘nelect’: Number of legislative terms in the assembly for each
