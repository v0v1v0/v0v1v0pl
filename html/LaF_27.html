<h2>Large File object</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A Large File object. This is a reference to a dataset on disk. The data
itself is not read into memory (yet). This can be done by the methods for
blockwise processing or by indexing the object as a data.frame. The code has
been optimised for fast access.
</p>


<h3>Objects from the Class</h3>

<p>Objects can be created by opening a file using one of the methods 
<code>laf_open_csv</code> or <code>laf_open_fwf</code>. These create a 
reference to either a CSV file or a fixed width file. The data in these
files can either be accessed using blockwise operations using the methods
<code>begin</code>, <code>next_block</code> and <code>goto</code>. Or by indexing the laf 
object as you would a data.frame. In the following example a CSV file
is opened and its first column (of type integer) is read into memory:
</p>
<pre>
   laf &lt;- laf_open_csv("file.csv", column_types=c("integer", "double"))
   data &lt;- laf[ , 1]
 </pre>
