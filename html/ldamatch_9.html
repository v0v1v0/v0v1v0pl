<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Chooses best set of subjects in a set.

</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>candidates</code></td>
<td>
<p>An iterator returning (or a list containing)
indices for the is.in logical vector whose in / out status
is to be changed.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>is.in</code></td>
<td>
<p>A logical vector showing which items are preserved
currently; versions resulting by changing indices for
each candidate are then compared.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>condition</code></td>
<td>
<p>A factor vector containing condition labels.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>covariates</code></td>
<td>
<p>A columnwise matrix containing
covariates to match the conditions on.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>halting_test</code></td>
<td>
<p>A function to apply to 'covariates' (in matrix form)
which is TRUE iff the conditions are matched.
Signature: halting_test(condition, covariates, thresh).
The following halting tests are part of this package:
<code>t_halt</code>, <code>U_halt</code>,
<code>l_halt</code>, <code>ad_halt</code>,
<code>ks_halt</code>, <code>wilks_halt</code>,
<code>f_halt</code>.
You can create the intersection of two or more halting
tests using <code>create_halting_test</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>thresh</code></td>
<td>
<p>The return value of halting_test has to be greater than
or equal to thresh for the matched groups.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>tiebreaker</code></td>
<td>
<p>NULL, or a function similar to halting_test, used to
decide between cases for which halting_test yields
equal values.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>props</code></td>
<td>
<p>Either the desired proportions (percentage) of the
sample for each condition as a named vector,
or the names of the conditions
for which we prefer to preserve the subjects,
in decreasing order of preference. If not specified, the
(full) sample proportions are used.
This is preferred among configurations with the same
taken into account by the other methods to some extent.
For example, c(A = 0.4, B = 0.4, C = 0.2) means that
we would like the number of subjects in groups A, B, and
C to be around 40%, 40%, and 20% of the total number of
subjects, respectively. Whereas c("A", "B", "C") means
that if possible, we would like to keep all subjects
in group A, and prefer keeping subjects in B, even if
it results in losing more subjects from C.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>prefer_test</code></td>
<td>
<p>If TRUE, prefers higher test statistic more than
the expected group size proportion; default is TRUE.
Used by all algorithms except exhaustive, which always</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>max_removed_per_cond</code></td>
<td>
<p>A named integer vector, containing the maximum number
of subjects that can be removed from each group.
Specify 0 for groups if you want to preserve
all of their subjects. If you do not specify a value
for a group, it defaults to 2 less than the group size.
Values outside the valid range of 0..(N-1)
(where N is the number of subjects in the group)
are corrected without a warning.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>ratio_for_slowdown</code></td>
<td>
<p>The p-value / threshold ratio at which
it starts removing subjects one by one.
Used when max_removed_per_step &gt; 1,
with a default value of 0.5.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>list(inds): A list containing the best index vectors indicating the
positions to flip in is.in.
