<h2>k-nearest neighbor denoising of a set of points</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Reduce noise in a high-dimensional dataset by averaging each point with its nearby neighbors.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">knnDenoise(X, block = rep(1, nrow(X)), k = 30, steps = 2)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>X</code></td>
<td>
<p>A matrix of numeric data, or something that can be cast to a matrix. Each row represents a point.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>block</code></td>
<td>
<p>Optional. A block for each row in X. A factor, or something that can be cast to a factor. Denoising will be performed independently within each block.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>k</code></td>
<td>
<p>Number of nearest neighbors to find around each point (including itself).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>steps</code></td>
<td>
<p>Number of steps to take along the directed k-nearest neighbor graph. <code>steps=1</code> uses the k-nearest neighbors, <code>steps=2</code> uses the k-nearest neighbors and their k-nearest neighbors, etc.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p><code>knnDenoise</code> first finds the <code>k</code>-nearest neighbors to each point (including the point itself). Then, for each point, the average is found of the points reachable in <code>steps</code> steps along the directed k-nearest neighbor graph.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">library(palmerpenguins)

completePenguins &lt;- na.omit(penguins[,c(1,3,4,5,6)])

# Dimensions need to be on comparable scales to apply knnDenoise
scaled &lt;- scale(completePenguins[,-1])

denoised &lt;- knnDenoise(scaled)
