<h2>Sample mode</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Calculate the mode of a sample: both modal value(s) and
the corresponding frequency
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">maxFreq(x, na.rm = TRUE)

modeOf(x, na.rm = TRUE)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>A vector containing the observations.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>na.rm</code></td>
<td>
<p>Logical value indicating whether NA values should be removed.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>These two functions can be used to calculate the mode (most
frequently observed value) of a sample, and the actual frequency of the
modal value. The only complication is in respect to missing data. If
<code>na.rm = FALSE</code>, then there are multiple possibilities for how to
calculate the mode. One possibility is to treat <code>NA</code> as another
possible value for the elements of <code>x</code>, and therefore if <code>NA</code>
is more frequent than any other value, then <code>NA</code> is the mode; and
the modal frequency is equal to the number of missing values. This is
the version that is currently implemented.
</p>
<p>Another possibility is to treat <code>NA</code> as meaning "true value unknown",
and to the mode of <code>x</code> is itself known only if the number of missing
values is small enough that – regardless of what value they have – they
cannot alter the sample mode. For instance, if <code>x</code> were
<code>c(1,1,1,1,2,2,NA)</code>, we know that the mode of <code>x</code> is <code>1</code>
regardless of what the true value is for the one missing datum; and we
know that the modal frequency is between 4 and 5. This is also a valid
interpretation, depending on what precisely it is the user wants, but
is not currently implemented.
</p>
<p>Because of the ambiguity of how <code>na.rm = FALSE</code> should be interpreted,
the default value has been set to <code>na.rm = TRUE</code>, which differs from
the default value used elsewhere in the package.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>The <code>modeOf</code> function returns the mode of <code>x</code>. If there
are ties, it returns a vector containing all values of <code>x</code> that have
the modal frequency. The <code>maxFreq</code> function returns the modal
frequency as a numeric value.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R"># simple example
eyes &lt;- c("green","green","brown","brown","blue")
modeOf(eyes)
maxFreq(eyes)

# vector with missing data
eyes &lt;- c("green","green","brown","brown","blue",NA,NA,NA)

# returns NA as the modal value.
modeOf(eyes, na.rm = FALSE)
maxFreq(eyes, na.rm = FALSE)

# returns c("green", "brown") as the modes, as before
modeOf(eyes, na.rm = TRUE)
maxFreq(eyes, na.rm = TRUE)
</code></pre>
