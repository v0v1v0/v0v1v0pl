<h2>Executes a function later</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Schedule an R function or formula to run after a specified period of time.
Similar to JavaScript's <code>setTimeout</code> function. Like JavaScript, R is
single-threaded so there's no guarantee that the operation will run exactly
at the requested time, only that at least that much time will elapse.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">later(func, delay = 0, loop = current_loop())
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>func</code></td>
<td>
<p>A function or formula (see <code>rlang::as_function()</code>).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>delay</code></td>
<td>
<p>Number of seconds in the future to delay execution. There is no
guarantee that the function will be executed at the desired time, but it
should not execute earlier.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>loop</code></td>
<td>
<p>A handle to an event loop. Defaults to the currently-active loop.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The mechanism used by this package is inspired by Simon Urbanek's
<a href="https://github.com/s-u/background">background</a> package and similar code in
Rhttpd.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A function, which, if invoked, will cancel the callback. The
function will return <code>TRUE</code> if the callback was successfully
cancelled and <code>FALSE</code> if not (this occurs if the callback has
executed or has been cancelled already).
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>To avoid bugs due to reentrancy, by default, scheduled operations only run
when there is no other R code present on the execution stack; i.e., when R is
sitting at the top-level prompt. You can force past-due operations to run at
a time of your choosing by calling <code>run_now()</code>.
</p>
<p>Error handling is not particularly well-defined and may change in the future.
options(error=browser) should work and errors in <code>func</code> should generally not
crash the R process, but not much else can be said about it at this point.
If you must have specific behavior occur in the face of errors, put error
handling logic inside of <code>func</code>.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R"># Example of formula style
later(~cat("Hello from the past\n"), 3)

# Example of function style
later(function() {
  print(summary(cars))
}, 2)

</code></pre>
