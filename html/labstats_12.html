<h2>Valproic acid (VPA) data set</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A mouse split-plot experiment with two treatments.
</p>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 24 rows and 5 variables:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>litter:</dt>
<dd>
<p>Mice were from one of six litters.</p>
</dd>
<dt>sex:</dt>
<dd>
<p>Male or Female.</p>
</dd>
<dt>group:</dt>
<dd>
<p>VPA or saline (SAL).</p>
</dd>
<dt>drug:</dt>
<dd>
<p>MPEP or saline (SAL).</p>
</dd>
<dt>activity:</dt>
<dd>
<p>Locomotor activity.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Six pregnant female mice were randomly assigned to receive
an injection of valproic acid (n = 3) or saline (n = 3). The
offspring of these mice (n = 24) were then randomly assigned to
receive an injection of the glutamate receptor antagonist MPEP (n =
12) or saline (n = 12). There are two levels of randomisation: the
pregnant females and their offspring.
</p>
<p>This is a subset of the full data set from Mehta et al., which
contained fourteen litters. The litters were selected to have an
equal sample size across all conditions for illustrative
purposes. The complete data can be found in the supplementary
material of Lazic and Essioux (2013).
