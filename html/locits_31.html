<h2>Interogates calculation store to see how well we are
reusing previous calculations (debugging)
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The computation of the variance of the lacf
estimator is intensive and we try to speed that up
by reusing calculations. These calculations are stored
in internal C arrays. This function interrogates those
arrays and can provide details on how well the storage
is working and provide hints if more storage needs to be
allocated. For very large time series it is possible that
values need to be calculated that can be stored and this
function can monitor this.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">StoreStatistics()
</code></pre>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The function prints out the state of the storage.
Three numbers are reported on. 1. The number of values
that were calculated but not stored "outside framework".
Ideally you want this number to be low, if it gets persistently
high then more storage needs to be allocated in the
C code (notably MAXELL, MAXJ, MAXK, MAXD for the
ThmStore and ValExists arrays). 
</p>
<p>The other two numbers are "Number stored" and "Number found".
The first number corresponds to the number of values calculated
once and then stored. The second number contains the
number of times the software interogated the store and found
a value that it did not have to then calculate. So,
ideally, you'd like the latter number to be a high percentage
of the former number, as this means the store is working
efficiently.
</p>
<p>Note, this function is definitely not intended for
casual users. However, for users of very large series,
who have the computational resources, these storage parameters
might need to be increased.
</p>
<p>The values will be zero if <code>Rvarlacf</code> has not
yet been called, and only refer to the last call to that function
(as the function zeroes the store on invocation).
