<h2>Tools for manipulating linear systems of (in)equations</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This package offers a basic and consistent interface to a number of
operations on linear systems of (in)equations not available in base R.
Except for the projection on the convex polytope, operations are currently
supported for dense matrices only.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The following operations are implemented.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Split matrices in independent blocks
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Remove spurious rows and columns from a system of (in)equations
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rewrite equalities in reduced row echelon form
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Eliminate variables through Gaussian or Fourier-Motzkin elimination
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Determine the feasibility of a system of linear (in)equations
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Compute Moore-Penrose Pseudoinverse
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Project a vector onto the convec polytope described by a set of linear (in)equations
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Simplify a system by substituting values
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Most functions assume a system of (in)equations to be stored in a standard form. The <code>normalize</code>
function can bring any system of equations to this form.
