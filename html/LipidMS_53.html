<h3>Details</h3>

<p>First, peak partitions are created based on the enviPick algorithm 
to speed up the following clustering algorithm. Briefly, peaks are ordered 
increasingly by mz and RT and grouped based on user-defined tolerances (dmz 
and drt). Each peak is initialized as a partition and then, they are 
evaluated to decide whether or not they can be joined to the previous 
partition. If mz and RT of a peak matches tolerance of any of the peaks in 
the previous partition, it is reassigned. Then, clustering algorithm is 
executed to improve these partitions based on their mz following the next 
steps for each partition:
</p>
<p>1.	Each peak in the partition is initialized as a new cluster. For each 
cluster we will keep the minimum, maximum and mean value of the mz, which at 
this point have the same values.
2.	Calculate a distance matrix between all clusters. This distance will be 
the greatest difference between minimum and maximum values of each cluster.
3.	While any distance is different to NA, search the minimum distance between 
two clusters.
4.	If distance is below the maximum distance allowed, join clusters and 
update minimum, maximum and mean values, else, set distance to NA and go back 
to point 3.
</p>
<p>Then this same clustring algorithm is executed again to group peaks based on 
their RT. In this case, distances between clusters which share peaks from the 
same samples will be set to NA.
</p>
<p>After groups have been defined, those clusters with a sample representation 
over minsamples or minsamplesfrac will be used for building the feature table.
