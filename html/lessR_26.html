<h2>Data for a Randomized Block Factorial ANOVA</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The data for this randomized blocks factorial is a partitioning of 48 rats into 8 groups of 6 based on an initial assessment of each rat's ability to navigate a maze. That is, some rats in general do better than others. A trial maze served as a sort of a pre-test in which the rats were sorted on the basis of their ability to solve the maze. The first block of 6 rats ran the trial maze the fastest, and the last block the slowest. Within each block the rats were randomly assigned to each of the 6 treatment combinations. Each block of matched rats provides a score on each of the six treatment combinations.
</p>
<p>This design is within-subjects because similar rats in terms of maze running ability provide the data for each block of data values. Each rat in this block only experiences one of the 6 cells, but all the rats in a block are evaluated across all 6 combinations of the levels of the two treatment variables.
