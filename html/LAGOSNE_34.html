<h2>LAGOSNE Spatial Classifications Metadata</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Data frames containing metadata for each spatial classification at which
ecological context data are derived in LAGOSNE. The spatial classifications
include 100m buffers (buffer100m),
500m buffers (buffer500m), interlake watersheds (iws),
hydrologic units (hu12, hu8, hu4), ecological drainage units (edu),
counties (county), and states (state). Each abbreviation is the name of the
data frame, with all or a subset of the following variables. For more
information about derivation of each spatial classification, see Details
below or Additional file 7 from <a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s13742-015-0067-4">doi:10.1186/s13742-015-0067-4</a>.
</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The nine LAGOSNE spatial classifications were used to summarize the ecological
context of each lake. Ecological context themes include
land use/land cover (LULC), connectivity (CONN), and climate, hydrology,
atmospheric deposition, and groundwater (CHAG). Not all themes were derived
at all classifications due to data availability. Briefly:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> iws: a dataframe with 51065 observations of 12 variables. The area
of land that drains directly into a lake, and into all
upstream-connected, permanent streams to that lake exclusive of any
upstream lake watersheds for lakes greater than  10 ha that are
connected via permanent streams.  For details on how the watersheds were
delineated, see additional file 8 in Soranno et al. (2015). Themes
derived at the iws classification include LULC and CONN.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> buffer100m: a dataframe with 51065 of 3 variables.
Buffers are a 100 m equidistant buffer of the land that is 100 m from
the lake shoreline, calculated using the ArcGIS Buffer tool. Themes
derived at the 100m buffer classification include LULC.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> buffer500m: a dataframe with 51065 of 3 variables.
Buffers are a 500 m equidistant buffer of the land that is 500 m from
the lake shoreline, calculated using the ArcGIS Buffer tool. Themes
derived at the 500m buffer classification include LULC and CONN.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> hu12: a dataframe with 20257 observations of 11 variables. The
Watershed Boundary Dataset defines boundaries based on surface water
drainage and creates nested Hydrologic Units (sometimes abbreviated and
referred to as HUCs, which are hydrologic unit codes) that are
georeferenced to the USGS 1:24,000 topographic base map. HUC12s are the
sixth level of classificiation. HUC12s are defined along natural
hydrologic breaks based on land surface and surface-water flow and they
have a single flow outlet except in frontal, lake, braided-stream, or
closed-basin hydrologic units. Themes derived at the HUC12
classification include LULC, CONN and CHAG.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> hu8: a data frame with 511 observations of 9 variables. HUC8s are
the fourth level of classificiation. Sometimes called 'watersheds', a
HUC8 is a geographic area representing part or all of a surface
drainage basin, a combination of drainage basins, or a distinct
hydrologic feature. Themes derived at the HUC8 classification include
LULC, CONN, and CHAG.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> hu4: a data frame with 65 observations of 9 variables. HUC4s are
the second level of classification, called a 'subregion'. A subregion
includes the area drained by a river system, a reach of a river and its
tributaries in that reach, a closed basin(s), or a group of streams
forming a coastal drainage area. Themes derived at the HUC4
classification include LULC, CONN, and CHAG.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> edu: a data frame with 91 observations of 10 variables.
Ecological drainage units (EDUs) follow the WBD boundaries, and are of
roughly similar size to HUC6s. EDUs were delineated by grouping the
HUC8 watersheds based on common zoogeographic history, and
physiographic and climatic characteristics. Themes derived at the EDU
classification include LULC, CONN, and CHAG.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> county: a data frame with 955 observations of 8 variables.
Counties (political boundary) within the 17-state region of LAGOSNE.
Themes derived at the county classification include LULC, CONN, and
CHAG.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> state: a dataframe with 17 observations of 7 variables. Themes
derived at the state classification include LULC, CONN, and CHAG.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
