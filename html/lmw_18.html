<h2>Assess balance for an <code>lmw</code> object</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Computes balance statistics for an <code>lmw</code> object created by
<code>lmw()</code>. Balance involves not only the similarity between the treatment
groups but also the similarity between each treatment group and the target
population.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">## S3 method for class 'lmw'
summary(
  object,
  un = TRUE,
  addlvariables = NULL,
  standardize = TRUE,
  data = NULL,
  stat = "balance",
  ...
)

## S3 method for class 'lmw_multi'
summary(
  object,
  un = TRUE,
  addlvariables = NULL,
  standardize = TRUE,
  data = NULL,
  contrast = NULL,
  stat = "balance",
  ...
)

## S3 method for class 'summary.lmw'
print(x, digits = max(3, getOption("digits") - 4), ...)

<h3>Details</h3>

<p><code>summary.lmw()</code> produces covariate balance or distribution
statistics and effective samples sizes before and after adjustment by the
regression weights and base weights, if supplied. For each covariate, the
following balance statistics are computed when <code>stat = "balance"</code>:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><code>SMD</code> - the standardized mean difference (SMD) between the
treated and control groups
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code style="white-space: pre;">⁠TSMD Treated⁠</code> - the target
standardized mean difference (TSMD) between the treated group and target
sample
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code style="white-space: pre;">⁠TSMD Control⁠</code> - the TSMD between between the control
group and target sample
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>KS</code> - the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS)
statistic between the treated and control groups
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code style="white-space: pre;">⁠TKS Treated⁠</code> -
the target KS (TKS) statistic between the treated group and target sample
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code style="white-space: pre;">⁠TKS Control⁠</code> - the TKS statistic between the control group and
target sample
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For multi-category treatments with <code>method = "MRI"</code>, balance statistics are
are computed between each treatment group and the target sample.
</p>
<p>When <code>stat = "distribution"</code> the mean and standard deviation of each
covariate is compute before and after adjustment and for the target sample.
(Standard deviations are printed in parentheses for visual clarity.)
</p>
<p>After weighting with the regression weights, the mean difference between
the treated and control groups of each covariate included in the original
call to <code>lmw()</code> will be equal to zero. However, the mean difference between
each treatment group and the target sample may not be equal to zero when
<code>method = "URI"</code> in the call to <code>lmw()</code>, and covariates supplied to
<code>addlvariables</code> not included in the call to <code>lmw()</code> may not be well
balanced.
</p>
<p>When <code>s.weights</code> are supplied to <code>lmw()</code>, the unadjusted statistics (if
requested) will incorporate the sampling weights. When <code>base.weights</code> are
supplied to <code>lmw()</code>, the unadjusted statistics will <em>not</em> incorporate the
base weights; rather, balance with base weights applied (if supplied) will
be produced in a separate balance table (see Value below).
</p>
<p>SMDs are computed as the difference between the (weighted) means divided by
a standardization factor, which is the standard deviation of the covariate
in the target sample. When <code>estimand = "ATT"</code> in the call to <code>lmw()</code>, the
standardization factor is the standard deviation in the treated group; when
<code>estimand = "ATC"</code>, the standardization factor is the standard deviation in
the control group; when <code>estimand = "ATE"</code> or when <code>estimand = "CATE"</code> and
a target profile is supplied, the standardization factor is the square root
of the average of the variances of both treatment groups; when <code>estimand = "CATE"</code>
and a target dataset is supplied, the standardization factor is the
standard deviation in the target dataset. When <code>s.weights</code> is supplied, the
standardization factor is computed including the sampling weights;
otherwise it is computed in the unweighted sample.
</p>
<p>For binary covariates, the KS statistic is equal to the unstandardized
difference in means and is computed as such.
</p>
<p>When <code>estimand = "CATE"</code> in the original call to <code>lmw()</code>, any variables
supplied to <code>addlvariables</code> that were not given a target value will not
have any target statistics computed (e.g., TSMD, TKS, target means, etc.).
</p>
<p>The effective sample size (ESS) is computed within each group as <code class="reqn">(\sum w)^2/\sum w^2</code>.
With uniform weights, this is equal to the sample size.
</p>
