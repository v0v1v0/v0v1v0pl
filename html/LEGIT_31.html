<h2>Gene-Environment correlation estimation and testing</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Estimates the gene-environment correlation (rGE) and tests for a GxE using a residual environmental score. If there is an important correlation between G and E, the model is still valid prediction-wise but the interpretation is affected as the question becomes: is it really a GxE or a GxG since E is partially caused by G? To account for this, we remove the influence of G on E (If E = b0 + b1*G + e, we use E_resid = E - b1*G) and refit the model to see if the model parameters changed. The residual environmental score (E_resid) is uncorrelated with G. This does not account for passive rGE but only active rGE.
