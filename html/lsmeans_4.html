<h2>Transition to <span class="pkg">emmeans</span>
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The <span class="pkg">lsmeans</span> package is being deprecated and further development will take
place in its successor, <span class="pkg">emmeans</span>. Users may use <span class="pkg">emmeans</span> in almost 
exactly the same way as <span class="pkg">lsmeans</span>, but a few function names and internal 
details are changed.</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>In transitioning to <span class="pkg">emmeans</span>, users will find that the vignettes are
constructed quite differently and that, in those and in the documentation,
emphasis is placed on “estimated marginal means” rather than 
“least-squares means”. The term “estimated marginal means” is 
broader and more appropriate 
for use with some models, e.g. ordinal regression, that don't really involve
least-squares methods. That is the reason for the change.
</p>
<p>Accordingly, <span class="pkg">emmeans</span> users are encouraged to use the functions <code>emmeans()</code>, 
<code>emtrends()</code>, <code>emmip()</code>, etc. in lieu of <code>lsmeans()</code>, etc.
The latter functions <em>are still available</em> in <span class="pkg">emmeans</span>; they run
the corresponding <code>emmxxxx</code> function and relabel the results.
</p>
<p>The <span class="pkg">emmeans</span> package provides some functions that help convert scripts and R Markdown
files containing <span class="pkg">lsmeans</span> code so they will work in <span class="pkg">emmeans</span>.
There is also a function to convert <code>ref.grid</code> and <code>lsmobj</code> objects
to the <code>emmGrid</code> objects used in <span class="pkg">emmeans</span>.
More extensive information is given in 
<code>vignette("transition-from-lsmeans", package = "emmeans")</code>.</p>
