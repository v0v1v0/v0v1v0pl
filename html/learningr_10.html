<h3>Note</h3>

<p>The dataset was kindly provided by Gwern Branwen.
</p>
<p><code>hafu2</code> is a lightly cleaned up version of
<code>hafu</code>.
</p>
<p>Gwern's notes: The following list includes manga, light
novel, anime, and video game characters (there being
little point in keeping the mediums separate). It also
includes characters who are not hafu themselves but a
quarter-foreign inasmuch as they imply a hafu at some
point. Characters are treated separately even if they are
in the same work (eg. siblings). Classification is based
on in-universe or out-of- universe information, since
appearance can be highly misleading in anime (blue eyes
may indicate heroic status, rather than being Caucasian;
hair color may be chosen for contrast against other
characters or signal stereotypes like red hair indicating
a fiery personality), and different groups will identify
the same anime character as belonging to their own race
(Lu 2009), perhaps due to minimalistic drawings intended
to save money or enable viewers to project themselves
onto a character.
