<h2>Glycogen content in rat livers</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>An experiment measuring the glycogen content in rat
livers that uses subsampling.
</p>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 36 rows and 4 variables:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>Glycogen:</dt>
<dd>
<p>Glycogen content.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Treatment:</dt>
<dd>
<p>A numeric treatment group indicator (1, 2, 3).</p>
</dd>
<dt>Rat:</dt>
<dd>
<p>Rat identification number. The numbers are not
unique; each treatment has a rat numbered 1 and 2, but these not
the same rats (rats are nested under treatment).</p>
</dd>
<dt>Liver:</dt>
<dd>
<p>A numeric variable indicating the liver piece. Each
liver was divided into three pieces.</p>
</dd>  </dl>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Six rats were randomised to three treatment conditions
(two per condition). Their livers were divided into three pieces
and two measurements were taken on each piece for 6 x 3 x 2 = 36
observations. The rats are the experimental units and there are two
levels of subsampling.
