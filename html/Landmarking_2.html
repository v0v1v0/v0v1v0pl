<h2>Simulated repeat measurement and time-to-event data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A simulated dataset which is a combination of longitudinal (repeat measurement) data and
time-to-event data.This dataset contains simulated data
from 3000 patients.
</p>
<p>The longitudinal (repeat measurement) data is formed using an LME model,
whose parameters were based on CVD risk assessments
recorded at primary care practices in New Zealand.
</p>
<p>A LME model was fitted to this dataset and values of <code>sbp_stnd</code>
and <code>tchdl_stnd</code> were estimated at landmark age 60. These values (along with the other baseline covariates)
were used to simulate time-to-event data from a
cause specific model with parameters based on CVD events of patients
at primary care practices in New Zealand.
