<h3>Description</h3>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The <code>longToWide</code> function is the companion function to
<code>wideToLong</code>. The <code>data</code> argument is a "long form" data frame,
in which each row corresponds to a single observation. The output is a
"wide form" data frame, in which each row corresponds to a single
experimental unit (e.g., a single subject).
</p>
<p>The reshaping formula should list all of the measure variables on the
left hand side, and all of the within-subject variables on the right
hand side. All other variables are assumed to be between-subject variables.
For example, if the <code>accuracy</code> of a participant's performance is
measured at multiple <code>time</code> points, then the formula would be
<code>accuracy ~ time</code>.
</p>
<p>Multiple variables are supported on both sides of the formula. For example,
suppose we measured the response time <code>rt</code> and <code>accuracy</code> of
participants, across three separate <code>days</code>, and across three separate
<code>sessions</code> within each day. In this case the formula would be
<code>rt + accuracy ~ days + sessions</code>.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>The output is a "wide form" data frame in containing one row per
subject (or experimental unit, more generally), with each observation of
that subject corresponding to a separate variable. The naming scheme for
these variables places the name of the measured variable first, followed
by the levels of within-subjects variable(s), separated by the separator
string <code>sep</code>. In the example above where the reshaping formula was
<code>accuracy ~ time</code>, if the default separator of <code>sep="_"</code> was
used, and the levels of the <code>time</code> variable are <code>t1</code>, <code>t2</code>
and <code>t3</code>, then the output would include the variables
<code>accuracy_t1</code>, <code>accuracy_t2</code> and <code>accuracy_t3</code>.
</p>
<p>In the second example listed above, where the reshaping formula was
<code>rt + accuracy ~ days + sessions</code>, the output variables would refer
to levels of both within-subjects variables. For instance,
<code>rt_day1_session1</code>, and <code>accuracy_day2_session1</code> might be the
names of two of the variables in the wide form data frame.
