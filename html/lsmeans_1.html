Least-squares means
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This package provides methods for obtaining so-called least-squares means for factor combinations in a variety of fitted linear models. It can also compute contrasts or linear combinations of these least-squares means, (several standard contrast families are provided), and in addition can estimate and contrast slopes of trend lines.
Popular adjustments for multiple-comparisons are provided, as well as graphical ways of displaying the results.
</p>
<p>Almost the entire codebase for <span class="pkg">lsmeans</span> now resides in the <span class="pkg">emmeans</span> package 
(named for the more general term, “estimated marginal means”). <span class="pkg">lsmeans</span> exists only as a transitional entity for the few remaining packages that depend on it.
