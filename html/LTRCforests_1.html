<h2>Constructs forest methods for left-truncated and right-censored (LTRC) survival data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Constructs a LTRC conditional inference forest (LTRCCIF) or
a LTRC relative risk forest (LTRCRRF) for left-truncated and right-censored data,
it also allows for (left-truncated) right-censored survival data with
time-varying covariates (Yao et al. 2022).
The main functions of this package are <code>ltrccif</code> and <code>ltrcrrf</code>.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>



<h4>Problem setup and existing methods</h4>

<p>Continuous-time survival data with time-varying covariates are common in practice.
Methods like the Cox proportional hazards model rely on restrictive assumptions such as
proportional hazards and a log-linear relationship between the hazard function and
covariates. Furthermore, because these methods are often parametric, nonlinear effects
of variables must be modeled by transformations or expanding the design matrix to
include specialized basis functions for more complex data structures in real world
applications. The functions <code>LTRCIT</code> and
<code>LTRCART</code> provide a conditional inference tree method and 
a relative risk tree method for
left-truncated right-censored survival data, which also allows for right-censored
survival data with time-varying covariates. Tree estimators are nonparametric and 
as such often exhibit
low bias and high variance. Ensemble methods like bagging and random forest can
reduce variance while preserving low bias. 
The most popular survival forest methods, including conditional inference forest
(see <code>cforest</code>), relative risk forest, and random survival 
forest method (see <code>rfsrc</code>) can only be applied to 
right-censored survival data with time-invariant covariates.</p>



<h4>LTRC forests</h4>

<p>This package implements <code>ltrccif</code> and <code>ltrcrrf</code>.
<code>ltrccif</code> extends the conditional inference forest
(see <code>cforest</code>) to LTRC survival data.
It uses LTRC conditional inference survival trees
as base learners.
<code>ltrcrrf</code> extends the relative risk forest
(Ishwaran et al. 2004) to left-truncated right-censored survival data.
It uses LTRC risk relative tree
as base learners.
The main functions <code>ltrccif</code> and <code>ltrcrrf</code> 
fit a corresponding LTRC forest for LTRC data, with parameter
<code>mtry</code> tuned by <code>tune.ltrccif</code> or <code>tune.ltrcrrf</code>. This tuning
procedure relies on the evaluation of the out-of-bag errors, which is performed by the
function <code>sbrier_ltrc</code>. <code>print</code>
prints summary output for <code>ltrccif</code> objects and <code>ltrcrrf</code> objects.
<code>predictProb</code>
constructs survival function estimates for <code>ltrccif</code> objects and <code>ltrcrrf</code> objects.
</p>
<p>For (left-truncated) right-censored survival data with time-varying covariates,
one can first reformat the data structure to one with LTRC observations,
where the multiple records of a subject become a list of pseudo-subjects and
are treated independently. This procedure is usually referred to as the
Andersen-Gill method (Andersen and Gill, 1982). Then LTRC forest methods
can be applied on this reformatted dataset.
</p>

<p>Overall, the methods in this package can handle all combinations of left truncation,
right censoring, time-invariant covariates, and time-varying covariates.
If one is in the traditional case with right-censored data
and time-invariant covariates, however, then it is recommended to use
the functions <code>cforest</code> and <code>rfsrc</code>
directly to construct conditional inference forests and random survival forests,
respectively.
