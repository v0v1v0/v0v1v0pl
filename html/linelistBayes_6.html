<h2>Generate Dummy Variables Matrix for Weeks and Weekends</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function creates a matrix of dummy variables based on reported weeks and weekend indicators.
Each column in the resulting matrix corresponds to a specific week, except for the last column,
which indicates whether the date falls on a weekend. This matrix is typically used in regression
models where week-specific effects are to be adjusted along with the effect of weekends.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">dummy(week, weekend)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>week</code></td>
<td>
<p>An integer vector representing the week number of each observation.
Each element denotes the week during which a specific event occurred.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>weekend</code></td>
<td>
<p>A binary integer vector (elements being 0 or 1) indicating whether
each observation corresponds to a weekend. Here, '1' indicates a weekend and '0' a weekday.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A numeric matrix where each row corresponds to an observation and each column
to a week, with an additional final column for weekend indicators. The elements
of the matrix are dummy variables (0 or 1); each row contains exactly one '1' in
one of the first several columns corresponding to the week of the observation,
and a '1' or '0' in the last column indicating weekend status.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">week &lt;- c(1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3)
weekend &lt;- c(0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0)
dummy_vars &lt;- dummy(week, weekend)
</code></pre>
