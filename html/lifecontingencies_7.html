Annuity function
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Function to calculate present value of annuities-certain.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">annuity(i, n, m = 0, k = 1, type = "immediate")
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>i</code></td>
<td>

<p>Effective interest rate expressed in decimal form. E.g. 0.03 means 3%. It can be a vector of interest rates of the same length
of periods. 
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>n</code></td>
<td>

<p>Periods for payments. If n = <code>infinity</code> then <code>annuity</code> returns the value of a perpetuity (either immediate or due). 
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>m</code></td>
<td>

<p>Deferring period, whose default value is zero.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>k</code></td>
<td>

<p>Yearly payments frequency. A payment of <code class="reqn">k^-1</code> is 
supposed to be performed at the end of each year.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>type</code></td>
<td>

<p>The Payment type, either <code>"advance"</code> for the annuity due (default)
or <code>"arrears"</code> for the annuity immediate.
Alternatively, one can use <code>"due"</code> or <code>"immediate"</code>
respectively (can be abbreviated).
</p>
</td>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This function calculates the present value of a stream of fixed payments 
separated by equal interval of time. Annuity immediate has the 
fist payment at time t = 0, while an annuity due has the first payment at time t = 1.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A string, either "immediate" or "due".
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>The value returned by annuity function derives from direct calculation of the discounted cash flow and 
not from formulas, like <code class="reqn">{a^{\left( m \right)}}_{\left. {\overline {\, 
 n \,}}\! \right| } = \frac{{1 - {v^n}}}{{{i^{\left( m \right)}}}}</code>. When m is greater than 
1, the payment per period is assumed to be <code class="reqn">\frac{1}{m}</code>.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R"># The present value of 5 payments of 1000 at one year interval that begins
# now when the interest rate is 2.5% is
1000 * annuity(i = 0.025, n = 5, type = "due")
# A man borrows a loan of 20,000 to purchase a car at
# a nominal annual rate of interest of 0.06. He will pay back the loan through monthly
# installments over 5 years, with the first installment to be made one month
# after the release of the loan. What is the monthly installment he needs to pay?
20000 / annuity(i = 0.06 / 12, n = 5 * 12)
