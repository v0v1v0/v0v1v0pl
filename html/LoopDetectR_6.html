<h2>Example ODE function: bacterial cell cycle.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The file contains the function definition an ordinary differential equation
model of Caulobacter crescentus cell cycle as proposed by Li et al., 2008. 
It has 18 variables.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">func_li08
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>R file with definition of function func_li08 that takes as
input arguments time t (dimension 1), and variable values y (dimension 18).
the kinetic parameters are defined within the function.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The Caulobacter cell cycle model function will only give the solution as 
shown in the publication [Li et al., 2008] if the change in variables at 
defined events are taken into account. Please refer to the original 
reference for details.
