<h2>Create a Value Labels Column for a Single Variable and Add to the Data Frame</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>For a single value-labeled column of a data.frame, create a copy of that
column that replaces all of its values with the corresponding value labels
and added that copy to the supplied data.frame.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">add_lab_col1(data, var, suffix = "_lab")

alc1(data, var, suffix = "_lab")
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>data</code></td>
<td>
<p>a data.frame.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>var</code></td>
<td>
<p>the unquoted name of the column (variable) whose values you wish
to replace with the corresponding value labels.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>suffix</code></td>
<td>
<p>a suffix that will be appended to the name of the labels-on
column that is added to the data.frame (e.g., if suffix = "_lab," the
labels-on version of "x1" will be "x1_lab").</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Note 1: <code>add_lab_col1</code> is a variant of <code>add_lab_cols</code> that allows you to
specify only one variable at a time but that allows you to pass its name
without quoting it (compare add_lab_col1(mtcars, am) to
add_lab_cols(mtcars, "am")).
</p>
<p>Note 2: <code>alc1</code> is a compact alias for <code>add_lab_col1</code>: they do the same thing,
and the former is easier to type.
</p>
<p>Note 3: This command is intended exclusively for interactive use. In
particular, the var argument must be the literal name of a single variable
(column) found in the supplied data.frame and may NOT be, e.g., the name of a
character vector that contains the variable (column name) of interest. If you
wish to supply a character vector with the names of variables (columns) of
interest, use <code>add_lab_cols()</code>.
</p>
<p><code>add_lab_col1</code> creates a "labels-on" version of a value-labeled column and
adds that new column to the supplied data.frame. Here, "labels-on" means that
the column's original values are replaced with the corresponding value
labels. Note that this column does not replace but is added to its
parent/source columns in the returned data.frame. The resulting "labels-on"
column is a simple, self-contained character column that cannot itself be
converted or reverted to the original ("labels-off") values of its
parent/source column. See <code>add_lab_cols</code> for a list of other functions that
may be useful in working with value labels.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A data.frame consisting of the originally supplied data.frame, along
with the labels-on column added to it.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R"># add "labels-on" version of "am" to copy of mtcars
df &lt;- mtcars # copy of mtcars

# now, add value labels
df &lt;- add_val1(
  data = df,
  var = am,
  vals = c(0, 1),
  labs = c("automatic", "manual")
)

# add value labels-on version of "am" to df, assign to df_plus
df_plus &lt;- add_lab_col1(df, am)
head(df_plus[c("am", "am_lab")])
</code></pre>
