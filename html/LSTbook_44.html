<h2>"Big Five" personality ratings for college first-year students</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Abstract from the research paper: Five-factor personality ratings were provided by undergraduate freshmen,
their parents, and their college peers as predictors of cumulative GPA
upon graduation. Conscientiousness ratings were significant
predictors of GPA by all three raters; peer ratings of
Conscientiousness were the only significant predictor of GPA when
self-, parent-, and peer-ratings of Conscientiousness
were examined simultaneously.
College major was a moderator of this relationship,
with self- and parent-ratings of Conscientiousness correlating
more strongly with GPA among Social Science majors and
parent-ratings of Conscientiousness correlating less
strongly with GPA among Science majors.
These findings replicate existing research regarding the
validity of informant ratings as predictors of behavioral outcomes
such as academic performance, while emphasizing the importance of
including multiple informants from various life contexts.
