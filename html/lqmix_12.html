<h2>Pain Data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The pain data frame is made by a total of 357 rows and 4 columns providing information on pain of 83 women in labor followed for a maximum of 6 measurement occasions
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(pain)
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 357 observations on the following 5 variables:
</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>id</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>woman id</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>meas</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>a numeric vector of self-reported pain scores on a 100mm line</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>trt</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>a dummy variable with values 1 for subjects who received a pain medication and 0 for subjects who received a placebo</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>time</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>a numeric vector of times (minutes since randomization) at which pain was measured</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The data set consists of repeated measurements of self-reported pain on n = 83 women.
43 women were randomly assigned to a pain medication group and 40 to a placebo group.
The response was measured every 30 minutes on a 100-mm line: 0 means no pain and 100 means extreme pain.
The number of measurements for each woman varies from 1 to 6.
Data are severely skewed, and the skewness changes magnitude, and even sign, over time.
