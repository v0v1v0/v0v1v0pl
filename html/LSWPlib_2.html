<h2>Best basis selection from a dyadic tree</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>best.basis</code> returns a selection of packets from a dyadic tree where the selection is made by minimizing the cost functionals associated with each packet.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">best.basis(wpc)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>wpc</code></td>
<td>
<p>this is a list containing the cost functionals associated with each packet. Each element in the list corresponds to a level of the dyadic tree.</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The function implements best basis selection from an arbitrary tree. Typically this tree is produced by other functions in this package and this function
is also used to produce a selected basis. Since best basis methods are of general interest this function has been exported
for possible other uses.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A matrix of two columns where each row refers to a different selected packet. The first index refers to the tree level, the second index refers to the packet within that level.
