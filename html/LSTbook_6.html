<h2>Anthropometric data from college-aged women</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Percentage of body fat, age, weight, height, body mass index and fourteen
circumference measurements are given for 184 college women ages 18-25.
Body fat was accurately determined by an underwater weighing technique
which requires special equipment and training of the individuals
conducting the process. Circumference measurements were made to the
nearest 0.1 cm using a cloth tape in complete contact with the skin
but without compression of the soft tissues. The measurement process,
described somewhat incompletely below, is described in greater detail in
Slack (1997) who used the standards recommended by Lohman, Roche and
Martrell (1988).
