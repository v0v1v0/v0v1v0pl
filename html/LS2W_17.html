<h2>
Environment containing precomputed objects.
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Package environment for commonly used objects in the LS2W methodology.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The <code>DWEnv</code> environment is used to store precomputed objects for the LS2W methodology.  Certain computations can be fairly long or intensive, and thus it is useful to store precomputed objects for reuse. 
These objects are namely autocorrelation wavelets (output from <code>PsiJ</code> and <code>PhiJ</code>), and bias correction matrices produced by <code>D2Amat</code>.
