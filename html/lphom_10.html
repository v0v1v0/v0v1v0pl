<code>sqrt</code>, or <code>sd</code>. Default, <code>constant</code> (i.e., wjk = 1). The wjk coefficients measure the
(relative) degree of confidence we have in the a priori values pjk0.
Everything else constant, the greater a weight wjk the closer the estimated pjk and

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Description of the <code>new_and_exit_voters</code> argument in more detail.
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><code>raw</code>: The default value. This argument accounts for the most plausible scenario when
estimating vote transfer matrices. A scenario with two elections elapsed at least
some months where only the raw election data recorded in the I (territorial) units,
in which the electoral space under study is divided, are available.
In this scenario, net exits and net entries are estimated according to
equation (7) of Romero et al. (2020). When both net entries and exits are no
null, constraint (15) of Pavia (2023) applies. If there are net exits and <code>uniform = TRUE</code>
either constraints (6) or (8) and (15) of Pavia (2023) are imposed. In this scenario,
J could be equal to J1 or J1 + 1 and K equal to K2 or K2 + 1.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>regular</code>: This value accounts for a scenario with
two elections elapsed at least some months where (i) the column J1
of <code>votes_election1</code> corresponds to new young electors who have the right
to vote for the first time, (ii) net exits and maybe other additional
net entries are computed according to equation (7) of Romero et al. (2020), and
(iii) we can (or not) assume that net exits impact equally all the first J1 - 1
options of election 1. When both net entries and exits are no null, constraints
(13) and (15) of Pavia (2023) apply. If <code>uniform = TRUE</code> and there are net exits either
constraints (8) or (11) of Pavia (2023), depending on whether there are or not net
entries, are also imposed. In this scenario, J could be equal to J1 or J1 + 1 and
K equal to K2 or K2 + 1. Note that this scenario could be also used if
column J1 of <code>votes_election1</code> would correspond to immigrants instead of
new young electors.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>ordinary</code>: This value accounts for a scenario
with two elections elapsed at least some months where (i) the column K1
of <code>votes_election2</code> corresponds to electors who died in the period between
elections, (ii) net entries and maybe other additional net exits are
computed according to equation (7) of Romero et al. (2020), and (iii) we can
assume (or not) that exits impact equally all the J1 options of election 1.
When both net entries and exits are no null, constraints (14) and
(15) of Pavia (2023) apply and if <code>uniform = TRUE</code> either constraints
(8) and (9) or, without net entries, (6) and (7) of Pavia (2023) are also imposed.
In this scenario, J could be equal to J1 or J1 + 1 and K equal to K2 or K2 + 1.
Note that this scenario could be also used if column K1 of
<code>votes_election2</code> would correspond to emigrants instead of deaths.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>enriched</code>: This value accounts for a scenario that somehow combine <code>regular</code> and
<code>ordinary</code> scenarios. We consider two elections elapsed at least some months where
(i) the column J1 of <code>votes_election1</code> corresponds to new young electors
who have the right to vote for the first time, (ii) the column K2 of
<code>votes_election2</code> corresponds to electors who died in the interperiod
election, (iii) other (net) entries and (net) exits are computed according
to equation (7) of Romero et al. (2020), and (iv) we can assume
(or not) that exits impact equally all the J1 - 1 options of election 1.
When both net entries and exits are no null, constraints (12) to
(15) of Pavia (2023) apply and if <code>uniform = TRUE</code> constraints
(10) and (11) of Pavia (2023) are also imposed. In this scenario, J could be equal
to J1 or J1 + 1 and K equal to K2 or K2 + 1. Note that this scenario could be also used if
the column J1 of <code>votes_election1</code> would correspond to immigrants instead of
new young electors and/or if column K1 of <code>votes_election2</code> would correspond
to emigrants instead of deaths.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>adjust1</code>: This value accounts for a scenario
with two elections elapsed at least some months where the census in
each of the I polling units of the first election (the row-sums of <code>votes_election1</code>) are
proportionally adjusted to match the corresponding census of the polling units in the
second election (the row-sums of <code>votes_election2</code>).
If <code>integers = TRUE</code>, each row in <code>votes_election1</code> is proportionally adjusted to the closest integer
vector whose sum is equal to the sum of the corresponding row in <code>votes_election2</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>adjust2</code>: This value accounts for a scenario
with two elections elapsed at least some months where the census in
each of the I polling units of the second election (the row-sums of <code>votes_election2</code>)
are proportionally adjusted to match the corresponding census of the polling units
in the first election (the row-sums of <code>votes_election1</code>).
If <code>integers = TRUE</code>, each row in <code>votes_election2</code> is adjusted to the closest integer
vector whose sum is equal to the sum of the corresponding row in <code>votes_election1</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>simultaneous</code>: This is the value to be used in classical ecological inference problems,
such as in ecological studies of racial voting, and in scenarios with two simultaneous elections.
In this scenario, the sum by rows of <code>votes_election1</code> and <code>votes_election2</code> must coincide.
Constraints defined by equations (8) and (9) of Romero et al. (2020) are not included in
the model. In this case, the lphom function just implements the basic model defined,
for instance, by equations (1) to (5) of Pavia (2024).
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>semifull</code>: This value accounts for a scenario with two elections elapsed at least some
months, where: (i) the column J1 = J of <code>votes_election1</code> totals new
electors (young and immigrants) that have the right to vote for the first time and
(ii) the column K2 = K of <code>votes_election2</code> corresponds to total exits of the census
lists (due to death or emigration). In this scenario, the sum by rows of
<code>votes_election1</code> and <code>votes_election2</code> must agree and constraint (15)
of Pavia (2023) apply. Additionally, if <code>uniform = TRUE</code> constraints
(8) of Pavia (2023) are also imposed.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>full</code>: This value accounts for a scenario with two elections elapsed at least some
months, where (i) the column J - 1 of <code>votes_election1</code> totals new young
electors that have the right to vote for the first time, (ii) the column J (=J1)
of <code>votes_election1</code> measures new immigrants that have the right to vote and
(iii) the column K (=K2) of <code>votes_election2</code> corresponds to total exits of the census
lists (due to death or emigration). In this scenario, the sum by rows of
<code>votes_election1</code> and <code>votes_election2</code> must agree and constraints (13)
and (15) of Pavia (2023) apply.  Additionally, if <code>uniform = TRUE</code> constraints
(11) of Pavia (2023) are also imposed.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>fullreverse</code>: This value is somehow the mirror version of <code>full</code>.
It accounts for a scenario with two elections elapsed at least some
months, where (i) the column J1 = J of <code>votes_election1</code> totals new
electors (young and immigrants) that have the right to vote for the first time and
(ii) where total exits are separated out between exits due to emigration
(column K - 1 of <code>votes_election2</code>) and death (column K of <code>votes_election2</code>).
In this scenario, the sum by rows of <code>votes_election1</code> and <code>votes_election2</code> must
agree and constraints (14) and (15) of Pavia (2023) apply.
Additionally, if <code>uniform = TRUE</code> constraints (8) and (9) of Pavia (2023) are also imposed.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>gold</code>: This value accounts for a scenario similar to <code>full</code>, where total exits are
separated out between exits due to emigration (column K - 1 of <code>votes_election2</code>)
and death (column K of <code>votes_election2</code>). In this scenario, the sum by rows
of <code>votes_election1</code> and <code>votes_election2</code> must agree. Constraints (12) to
(15) of Pavia (2023) apply and if <code>uniform = TRUE</code> constraints (10) and (11)
of Pavia (2023) are also imposed.
