<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This study investigated whether a story spoiler that gives away the ending early diminishes suspense
and hurts enjoyment.  For twelve different short stories, the
study's authors created a second version in which a spoiler paragraph at the beginning discussed the
story and revealed the outcome. Each version of the twelve stories was read by at least 30 people and
rated on a 1 to 10 scale to create an overall rating for the story, with higher ratings indicating greater
enjoyment of the story.  Stories 1 to 4 were ironic twist stories, stories 5 to 8 were mysteries,
and stories 9 to 12 were literary stories.
