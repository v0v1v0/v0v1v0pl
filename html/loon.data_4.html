<h2>Relative Spinal Bone Mineral Density Data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>From the web source: 
"Relative spinal bone mineral density measurements on 261 North
American adolescents.  Each value is the difference in spnbmd
taken on two consecutive visits, divided by the average. The age is
the average age over the two visits."
</p>
<p>The data are a repackaging and extension of the data of the same name
from the now archived (in 2020) of the 2015 'ElemStatLearn' package of Kjetil B. Halvorsen.
</p>
<p>The principal changes here is the renaming of the variables <code>gender</code> and <code>spnbmd</code> AND in 
the addition of a new variable <code>ethnic</code> derived from the <code>bone_ext</code> data set.
</p>
<p>The variables <code>gender</code> and <code>spnbmd</code> were renamed to <code>sex</code> and <code>rspnbmd</code>,
respectively, to better agree with names in the larger and more complete data set <code>bone_ext</code> 
taken from the same study and source webpage.  The variable <code>ethnic</code> was extracted from
<code>bone_ext</code> by matching 'idnum' in the two datasets.
</p>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 485 rows and 5 variables
</p>

<dl>
<dt>idnum</dt>
<dd>
<p>Identifies the subject, and hence the repeat measurements</p>
</dd>
<dt>age</dt>
<dd>
<p>Age of subject averaged over the two times measurements of 
<code>spnbmd</code> were taken to determine the relative change <code>rspnbmd</code>.</p>

<dt>sex</dt>
<dd>
<p>Sex of the subject.  A factor with levels "female" and "male".</p>
</dd>
<dt>rspnbmd</dt>
<dd>
<p>Relative spinal bone mineral density measurement. 
Each value is the (unitless) difference in <code>spnbmd</code>' taken on two 
consecutive visits, divided by the average of the two measurements.</p>
</dd>
<dt>ethnic</dt>
<dd>
<p>The "ethnicity/race" of the subject.  A factor with levels 
"Asian", "Black", "Hispanic", and "White".</p>

<p>The row order of the values follow their order of appearence in the source webpage.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The purpose of the study was to examine ethnic and sex differences in bone mineral acquisition over
time for young (aged 9-25 years) healthy Asian, black, Hispanic, and white males and females.
The study recorded areal bone mineral density (BMD) in grams per square centimetre in the lumbar spine.
</p>
<p>These data are a subset of 261 subjects taken from a convenience sample of 
423 healthy young people of various "ethnicities."   
</p>
<p>The source website does not describe how this subset was chosen.
</p>
<p>Rather than the <code>spnbmd</code> measurement at each visit of a subject (as with 'bone_ext'),
the response <code>rspnbmd</code> denotes the relative change in <code>spnbmd</code> between visits and is
calculated as the difference between the later and early visit values of <code>spnbmd</code> divided
by the average of these two values.  The 'age' variable is similarily taken to be
the average of the subject's ages at the two visits.
</p>
<p>On the subjects (Bachrach et al, 1999): 
</p>
<p>"A convenience sample of healthy youth was recruited from the community
through advertisements and personal contact (21, 22). Individuals
with a history of medical conditions or use of medications affecting
bone mineral were excluded. Subjects were encouraged to return annually
for a total of four visits or until they had reached age 26 yr.
Recruitment occurred between May 1992 and February 1996; data collection
ended in February 1997. The cohort at entry included 103 non-Hispanic whites, 
103 Hispanics, 103 Asians, and 114 non-Hispanic blacks, aged 8.8 â€“25.9 yr; 
230 females and 193 males were enrolled as previously reported (22). 
For simplicity, ethnicity and race will be used as interchangeable terms, 
and the groups will be referred to as white, Hispanic, Asian, and black.
A total of 280 subjects completed 2 visits; 189 were studied 3 times, and 
113 were evaluated 4 times. Subjects who completed fewer than 4 visits included 
those who refused, relocated, or reached age 26 yr during the study period; 
in addition, subjects who were recruited late in the study did not complete 
all visits because funding had terminated.
</p>
<p>So-called "ethnicity" can be found in the data set 'bone_ext'.
