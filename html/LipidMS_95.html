<h3>Details</h3>

<p><code>idSMneg</code> function involves 5 steps. 1) FullMS-based
identification of candidate SM as M+CH3COO, M-CH3 or M+CH3COO-CH3. 2) Search 
of SM class fragments: 168.0426, 224.0688 or loss of CH3 coeluting with the 
precursor ion. 3) Search of specific fragments that inform about chain 
composition in sn1 (Sph+phosphocholine as M-CH3-H2O which results in a mass 
difference of Sph+150.032) and sn2 (difference between precursor and sn1 chain
fragments). 4) Look for possible chains structure based on the
combination of chain fragments. 5) Check intensity rules to confirm chains 
position. In this case, there are no intensity rules by default.
</p>
<p>Results data frame shows: ID, lipid class, CDB (total number
of carbons and double bounds), FA composition (specific chains composition if
it has been confirmed), mz, RT (in seconds), I (intensity, which comes
directly from de input), Adducts, ppm (mz error), confidenceLevel (Subclass,
FA level, where chains are known but not their positions, or FA position
level) and Score (parent-fragment coelution score mean in DIA data or relative 
sum intensity in DDA of all fragments used for the identification).
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>annotated msobject (list with several elements). The results element
is a data frame that shows: ID, lipid class, CDB (total number of carbons
and double bounds), FA composition (specific chains composition if it has
been confirmed), mz, RT (in seconds), I (intensity), Adducts, ppm (mz error),
confidenceLevel (Subclass, FA level, where chains are known but not their
positions, or FA position level), peakID, and Score (parent-fragment coelution 
score mean in DIA data or relative sum intensity in DDA of all fragments used 
for the identification).
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>This function has been writen based on fragmentation patterns
observed for three different platforms (QTOF 6550 from Agilent, Synapt G2-Si
from Waters and Q-exactive from Thermo), but it may need to be customized for
other platforms or acquisition settings.
