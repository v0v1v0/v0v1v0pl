<h2>Genetically modified soybean litter decomposition</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Soybean litter decomposition as a function of time (<code>date</code>), type of
litter (<code>variety</code>), herbicides applied (<code>herbicide</code>), and where in the soil
profile it is placed (<code>profile</code>). <code>masslost</code> refers to the proportion of the
litter that was lost from the bag (decomposed) relative to the start of the experiment.
Herbicide treatments were applied at the level of whole plots, with both treatments
represented within each of four blocks. Both levels of variety and profile were each
represented within each plot, with six replicates of each treatment added to each plot.

<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">masslost
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 246 rows and 8 variables:
</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>plot</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>integer A total of eight plots.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>block</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>integer A total of four blocks.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>variety</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>integer Soybean variety is genetically modified ('gm') or not
('nongm'); manipulated at the subplot level.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>herbicide</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>integer Herbicide applied is glyphosate ('gly') or conventional
program ('conv'); manipulated at plot level.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>profile</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>integer Whether litter was 'buried' in the soil or placed at the
soil 'surface'; manipulated at the subplot level.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>date</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>integer Date at which litter bags were recovered.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>sample</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>integer Factor representing timing of sampling ('incrop1',
'incrop2', 'postharvest').</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>masslost</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>double The proportion of the initial mass that was lost from
each litter bag during field incubation. Some values are lower than zero due to
insufficient washing of dirt and biota from litter prior to weighing.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
