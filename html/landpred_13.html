Estimates P(TL &lt;t0+tau | TL &gt; t0, Z, min(TS, t0), I(TS&lt;=t0)), i.e. given discrete covariate and TS information.
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>


<p>This function calculates the probability that the an individual has the event of interest before t0 + tau given the discrete covariate, given short term event information, and given the event has not yet occurred and the individual is still at risk at time t0.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">Prob.Covariate.ShortEvent(t0, tau, data, weight = NULL, bandwidth = NULL, newdata=NULL)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>t0</code></td>
<td>


<p>the landmark time.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>tau</code></td>
<td>


<p>the residual survival time for which probabilities are calculated. Specifically, this function estimates the probability that the an individual has the event of interest before t0 + tau given the event has not yet occurred and the individual is still at risk at time t0.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>data</code></td>
<td>


<p>n by 5 matrix. A data matrix where the first column is XL = min(TL, C) where TL is the time of the long term event, C is the censoring time, and the second column is DL =1*(TL&lt;C), the third column is XS = min(TS, C) where TS is the time of the short term event, C is the censoring time, the fourth column is DS =1*(TS&lt;C), and the fifth column is the covariate. These are the data used to calculate the estimated probability.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>weight</code></td>
<td>


<p>a weight to be incorporated in all estimation.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>bandwidth</code></td>
<td>


<p>an optional bandwidth to be used in kernel smoothing; is not provided then function calculates an appropriate bandwidth using bw.nrd and then undersmoothing with c = .10 (See reference)
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>newdata</code></td>
<td>

<p>an optional n by 5 matrix where the first column is XL = min(TL, C) where TL is the time of the long term event, C is the censoring time, and the second column is DL =1*(TL&lt;C), the third column is XS = min(TS, C) where TS is the time of the short term event, C is the censoring time, the fourth column is DS =1*(TS&lt;C), and the fifth column is the covariate. Predicted probabilities are estimated for these data.

<h3>Value</h3>






<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>data</code></td>
<td>
<p>the data matrix with an additional column with the estimated individual probabilities; note that the predicted probability is NA if TL &lt;t0 since it is only defined for individuals with TL&gt; t0</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>newdata</code></td>
<td>
<p>the newdata matrix with an additional column with the estimated individual probabilities; note that the predicted probability is NA if TL &lt;t0 since it is only defined for individuals with TL&gt; t0; if newdata is not supplied then this returns NULL</p>
