<h3>Details</h3>

<p><code>idTGpos</code> function involves 5 steps. 1) FullMS-based
identification of candidate TG as M+NH4 and M+Na. 2) Search of TG class
fragments: there are no class fragment by default. 3) Search of specific
fragments that inform about the FA chains: DGs resulting from the loss of FA
chains as M+H-H2O.  4) Look for possible chains structure based on the
combination of chain fragments. 5) Check intensity rules to confirm chains
position. In the case of TG, DG resulting from the loss of sn2 if the most
intense, followed by the loss of sn1 and sn3, but this FA position level
still needs to be improved due to the high level of coelution for TG.
</p>
<p>Results data frame shows: ID, lipid class, CDB (total number
of carbons and double bounds), FA composition (specific chains composition if
it has been confirmed), mz, RT (in seconds), I (intensity, which comes
directly from de input), Adducts, ppm (mz error), confidenceLevel (Subclass,
FA level, where chains are known but not their positions, or FA position
level) and Score (parent-fragment coelution score mean in DIA data or relative 
sum intensity in DDA of all fragments used for the identification).
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>annotated msobject (list with several elements). The results element
is a data frame that shows: ID, lipid class, CDB (total number of carbons
and double bounds), FA composition (specific chains composition if it has
been confirmed), mz, RT (in seconds), I (intensity), Adducts, ppm (mz error),
confidenceLevel (Subclass, FA level, where chains are known but not their
positions, or FA position level), peakID, and Score (parent-fragment coelution 
score mean in DIA data or relative sum intensity in DDA of all fragments used 
for the identification).
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>This function has been written based on fragmentation patterns
observed for three different platforms (QTOF 6550 from Agilent, Synapt G2-Si
from Waters and Q-exactive from Thermo), but it may need to be customized for
other platforms or acquisition settings.
