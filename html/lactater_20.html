<h3>Details</h3>



<h4>Log-log</h4>

<p>The lactate response (i.e., log of lactate vs intensity) is divided into two segments.
A segmented regression is then performed such that the lactate curve would present one breaking point. The exercise
intensity at which the breaking point occurs is then considered as Log-log (Beaver et al., 1985).
Caution: this method might require a double-check via a visual inspection, depending in some cases.
</p>



<h4>OBLA</h4>

<p>The Onset of Blood Lactate Accumulation (OBLA) is the exercise intensity at fixed lactate of 2.0, 2.5,
3.0, 3.5, and 4.0 mmol/L (Heck et al., 1985, Kindermann et al., 1979; Skinner &amp; Mclellan, 1980). The lactate curve is usually fitted using a 3rd order polynomial regression curve,
but the user can define another method (4th degree polynomial or B-spline).
</p>



<h4>Bsln+</h4>

<p>In the baseline plus method (Bsln+), the exercise intensity at which lactate increases to 0.5, 1.0,
and 1.5 mmol/L above baseline (resting) values is considered (Berg et al., 1990; Zoladz et al., 1995). The lactate curve is usually fitted using a
3rd order polynomial regression curve,
but the user can define another method (4th degree polynomial or B-spline).
</p>



<h4>Dmax</h4>



<h5>Dmax</h5>

<p>The exercise intensity that yields the maximum perpendicular distance to the straight line
between the first and the last data point (Cheng et al., 1992). The lactate curve is fitted using a 3rd order polynomial regression curve,
and it can't be changed.
</p>



<h5>Modified Dmax (ModDmax)</h5>

<p>The exercise intensity that yields the maximum perpendicular distance to the straight line
between data point preceding the first rise in lactate greater than 0.4 mmol/L and the last
data point (Bishop et al., 1998). The lactate curve is fitted using a 3rd order polynomial regression curve,
and it can't be changed.
</p>



<h5>Exponential Dmax (Exp-Dmax)</h5>

<p>The exercise intensity on the exponential plus-constant regression lactate curve that
yields the maximum perpendicular distance to the straight line between the first and the
last data point (Hughson et al., 1987). The lactate curve is fitted using an exponential curve,
and it can't be changed.
</p>



<h5>Log-log modified Dmax (Log-Poly-ModDmax)</h5>

<p>The exercise intensity that yields the maximum perpendicular distance to the straight line
between Log-log and the last data point in the 3rd order polynomial regression curve (Jamnick et al., 2018).
The lactate curve is fitted using a 3rd order polynomial regression curve,
and it can't be changed.
</p>



<h5>Log-log exponential Dmax (Log-Exp-ModDmax)</h5>

<p>The exercise intensity that yields the maximum perpendicular distance to the straight line
between Log-log and the last data point in the exponential curve (Jamnick et al., 2018).
The lactate curve is fitted using an exponential curve,
and it can't be changed.
</p>




<h4>LTP</h4>



<h5>Lactate Turning Point 1 (LTP1) and Lactate Turning Point 2 (LTP2)</h5>

<p>the lactate response is divided into three segments. A segmented regression is performed
such that the lactate curve yields two breaking points. The first breaking point, representing
the first rise in lactate above resting levels, is considered as LTP1. The second breaking point,
representing an accelerated lactate accumulation, is then considered as LTP2
(Hofmann &amp; Tschakert, 2017; Hofmann et al., 1997; Pokan et al., 1997).
Caution: this method might require a double-check via a visual inspection, depending in some cases.
</p>




<h4>LTratio</h4>

<p>The lactate response (i.e., ratio of lactate / exercise intensity vs exercise intensity) is interpolated
using a B-spline regression curve. LTratio is then defined as the lowest value of the lactate / exercise intensity
ratio, which attempts to describe the onset of the lactate increase (Dickhuth et al., 1999).
