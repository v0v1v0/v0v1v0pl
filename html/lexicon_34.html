<h2>Colin Martindale's English Regressive Imagery Dictionary</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A dataset containing Colin Martindale's (1975, 1990) English Regressive Imagery 
Dictionary (RID).  The Regressive Imagery Dictionary (RID) is a text analysis
coding taxonomy that can be used to measure the degree to which a text is 
<em>primordial</em> vs. <em>conceptual</em>.  This acts as a proxy for assessing the 
illuctioner's mental thinking in producing the text. This dictionary is 
essentially a bucketed grouping of regexes'  The main level of bucketing is
<em>thinking</em> and is either <em>primordial</em> vs. <em>conceptual</em>.
Under the primordial group is the <em>primary</em> process group while the conceptual
thinking includes <em>secondary</em> and <em>emotional</em> process groups.  These
can be further broken into categories and subcategories (subcategories for 
primary process only).  Comparing the percentages of the buckets provides
insight into the writer's thinking.  This particular list was taken from 
https://github.com/jefftriplett/rid.py.
