<h2>New test of second-order stationarity and confidence intervals
for localized autocovariance.
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Provides functionality to perform a new test of
second-order stationarity for time series. The method
works by computing a wavelet periodogram and then examining
its Haar wavelet coefficients for significant ones.
The other main feature of the software is to compute the
localized autocovariance and pointwise confidence intervals.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>For the test of stationarity there are two main functions.
The original is
the <code>hwtos2</code> function and this returns a
<code>tos</code> object. The <code>hwtos2</code> function
works on data sets whose length is a power of two. Version 1.5
introduced a new function, <code>hwtos</code> which carries out the
test on arbitrary length data.
The <code>summary.tos</code> function
performs a Bonferroni and FDR statistical analysis to detect
which Haar wavelet coefficients are significant. The
function <code>plot.tos</code> provides a plot of the
original time series with any non-stationarities clearly indicated
on the plot (actually locations and scales of the Haar wavelet coefficients).
</p>
<p>For the localized autocovariance the main function is
<code>Rvarlacf</code>. This computes the localized autocovariance
values and approximate pointwise condifence intervals. The function
<code>plot.lacfCI</code> can then plot the localized autocovariance
and its confidence intervals in a number of forms.

#summary(.):
#----------
#There are  186  hypothesis tests altogether
#There were  4  FDR rejects
#The rejection p-value was  0.0001376564 
#Using Bonferroni rejection p-value is  0.0002688172 
#And there would be  4  rejections.

# In the lines above if there are any rejects then the series is
# deemed to be nonstationary, and note that there were 4 in both
# the lines above (sometimes FDR rejects a few more).
#
# You can also plot the object and it shows you where it thinks the
# nonstationarities are
#
## Not run: plot(st.test)
#
# See the help page for the hwtos2 function, where there is an example
# with a stationary series.
#
# For the localized autocovariance...
#
# Let's use the function tvar1sim which generates a time-varying AR model
# with AR(1) paramter varying over the extent of the series from 0.9
# to -0.9 (that is, near the start of the series it behaves like an
# AR(1) with parameter 0.9, and near the end like an AR(1) with parameter
# -0.9, and in between the parameter is somewhere between 0.9 and -0.9
# figured linearly between the two.
#
x &lt;- tvar1sim()
#
# Plot it, so you know what the series looks like, should always do this.
#
## Not run: ts.plot(x)
#
# Now, let's compute the localized autocovariance and also confidence intervals
# For the variance, let's look at the first 20 lags
#
# Do it at t=50 and t=450, ie what is the localized autocovariance at these
# two times.
#
x.lacf.50 &lt;- Rvarlacf(x=x, nz=50, var.lag.max=20)
x.lacf.450 &lt;- Rvarlacf(x=x, nz=450, var.lag.max=20)
#
# Now plot the answers, you may want to do this on two different plots
# so that you can compare the answers
#
#
## Not run: plot(x.lacf.50, plotcor=FALSE, type="acf")
## Not run: plot(x.lacf.450, plotcor=FALSE, type="acf")
#
# Note that the plotcor argument is set so covariances and not correlations
# are plotted. Also, the type is set to "acf" to make the plot *look* like
# the regular acf plot. But DON'T be fooled, it is not the regular acf
# that is plotted, but a time localized plot. The two plots should look
# very different, both like AR(1) but with different parameters (from the
# same time series).
#
# You could also plot the regular acf and see how it gets it wrong!
