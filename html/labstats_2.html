<h2>Data to compare the use of blocking and covariate adjustment</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Simulated data to illustrate the effects of blocking
versus adjusting for a covariate.
</p>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 8 rows and 6 variables:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>weight:</dt>
<dd>
<p>A baseline measurement of body weight for eight
rats. The rows of the data frame are sorted according to weight
(lightest to heaviest).</p>
</dd>
<dt>block:</dt>
<dd>
<p>Rats are grouped into four blocks based on body
weight.</p>
</dd>
<dt>RBD:</dt>
<dd>
<p>Treatment group when using a randomised block design
(RBD).</p>
</dd>
<dt>CRD:</dt>
<dd>
<p>Treatment group when using a completely randomised
design (CRD).</p>
</dd>
<dt>y.RBD:</dt>
<dd>
<p>Outcome variable under the RBD.</p>
</dd>
<dt>y.CRD:</dt>
<dd>
<p>Outcome variable under the CRD.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The experimental manipulation is a new diet versus a
standard control diet and the outcome is the amount of food eaten
on each diet. Since rats that weigh more at the beginning of the
experiment are expected to eat more food, regardless of the diet,
it would be beneficial to account for this source of
variation. This can be done either through use of blocking or
covariate adjustment and data for both designs are included. Note
that only one design could be used in a real experiment but here we
generate outcome values for two experiments using the same baseline
body weight values.
</p>
<p>For the randomised block design the eight rats are ranked according to
baseline body weight and grouped into four blocks of two (the two
lightest rats form the first block, the next two the second, and so
on). Assignment to treatment group is done within blocks.
