<h2>Laplace Approximation</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The <code>LaplaceApproximation</code> function deterministically maximizes
the logarithm of the unnormalized joint posterior density with one of
several optimization algorithms. The goal of Laplace Approximation is
to estimate the posterior mode and variance of each parameter. This
function is useful for optimizing initial values and estimating a
covariance matrix to be input into the
<code>IterativeQuadrature</code>, <code>LaplacesDemon</code>,
<code>PMC</code>, or <code>VariationalBayes</code> function, or
sometimes for model estimation in its own right.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">LaplaceApproximation(Model, parm, Data, Interval=1.0E-6,
     Iterations=100, Method="SPG", Samples=1000, CovEst="Hessian",
     sir=TRUE, Stop.Tolerance=1.0E-5, CPUs=1, Type="PSOCK")
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>Model</code></td>
<td>
<p>This required argument receives the model from a
user-defined function. The user-defined function is where the model
is specified. <code>LaplaceApproximation</code> passes two arguments to
the model function, <code>parms</code> and <code>Data</code>. For more
information, see the <code>LaplacesDemon</code> function and
“LaplacesDemon Tutorial” vignette.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>parm</code></td>
<td>
<p>This argument requires a vector of initial values equal in
length to the number of parameters. <code>LaplaceApproximation</code> will
attempt to optimize these initial values for the parameters, where
the optimized values are the posterior modes, for later use with the
<code>IterativeQuadrature</code>, <code>LaplacesDemon</code>,
<code>PMC</code>, or the <code>VariationalBayes</code> function.
The <code>GIV</code> function may be used to randomly generate
initial values. Parameters must be continuous.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>Data</code></td>
<td>
<p>This required argument accepts a list of data. The list of
data must include <code>mon.names</code> which contains monitored variable
names, and <code>parm.names</code> which contains parameter
names. <code>LaplaceApproximation</code> must be able to determine the
sample size of the data, and will look for a scalar sample size
variable <code>n</code> or <code>N</code>. If not found, it will look for
variable <code>y</code> or <code>Y</code>, and attempt to take its number of
rows as sample size. <code>LaplaceApproximation</code> needs to determine
sample size due to the asymptotic nature of this method. Sample size
should be at least <code class="reqn">\sqrt{J}</code> with <code class="reqn">J</code> exchangeable
parameters.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>Interval</code></td>
<td>
<p>This argument receives an interval for estimating
approximate gradients. The logarithm of the unnormalized joint
posterior density of the Bayesian model is evaluated at the current
parameter value, and again at the current parameter value plus this
interval.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>Iterations</code></td>
<td>
<p>This argument accepts an integer that determines the
number of iterations that <code>LaplaceApproximation</code> will attempt
to maximize the logarithm of the unnormalized joint posterior
density. <code>Iterations</code> defaults to 100.
<code>LaplaceApproximation</code> will stop before this number of
iterations if the tolerance is less than or equal to the
<code>Stop.Tolerance</code> criterion. The required amount of computer
memory increases with <code>Iterations</code>. If computer memory is
exceeded, then all will be lost.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>Method</code></td>
<td>
<p>This optional argument accepts a quoted string that
specifies the method used for Laplace Approximation. The default
method is <code>Method="SPG"</code>. Options include <code>"AGA"</code> for
adaptive gradient ascent, <code>"BFGS"</code> for the
Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno algorithm, <code>"BHHH"</code> for the
algorithm of Berndt et al., <code>"CG"</code> for conjugate gradient,
<code>"DFP"</code> for the Davidon-Fletcher-Powell algorithm,
<code>"HAR"</code> for adaptive hit-and-run, <code>"HJ"</code> for
Hooke-Jeeves, <code>"LBFGS"</code> for limited-memory BFGS, <code>"LM"</code>
for Levenberg-Marquardt, <code>"NM"</code> for Nelder-Mead, <code>"NR"</code>
for Newton-Raphson, <code>"PSO"</code> for Particle Swarm Optimization,
<code>"Rprop"</code> for resilient backpropagation, <code>"SGD"</code> for
Stochastic Gradient Descent, <code>"SOMA"</code> for the Self-Organizing
Migration Algorithm, <code>"SPG"</code> for Spectral Projected Gradient,
<code>"SR1"</code> for Symmetric Rank-One, and <code>"TR"</code> for Trust
Region.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>Samples</code></td>
<td>
<p>This argument indicates the number of posterior samples
to be taken with sampling importance resampling via the
<code>SIR</code> function, which occurs only when
<code>sir=TRUE</code>. Note that the number of samples should increase
with the number and intercorrelations of the parameters.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>CovEst</code></td>
<td>
<p>This argument accepts a quoted string that indicates how
the covariance matrix is estimated after the model finishes. This
covariance matrix is used to obtain the standard deviation of each
parameter, and may also be used for posterior sampling via Sampling
Importance Resampling (SIR) (see the <code>sir</code> argument below), if
converged. By default, the covariance matrix is approximated as the
negative inverse of the <code>"Hessian"</code> matrix of second
derivatives, estimated with Richardson extrapolation. Alternatives
include <code>CovEst="Identity"</code>, <code>CovEst="OPG"</code>, or
<code>CovEst="Sandwich"</code>. When <code>CovEst="Identity"</code>, the
covariance matrix is not estimated, and is merely assigned an
identity matrix. When <code>LaplaceApproximation</code> is
performed internally by <code>LaplacesDemon</code>, an identity
matrix is returned and scaled. When <code>CovEst="OPG"</code>, the
covariance matrix is approximated with the inverse of the sum of the
outer products of the gradient, which requires <code>X</code>, and either
<code>y</code> or <code>Y</code> in the list of data. For OPG, a partial
derivative is taken for each row in <code>X</code>, and each element in
<code>y</code> or row in <code>Y</code>. Therefore, this requires <code class="reqn">N + NJ</code>
model evaluations for a data set with <code class="reqn">N</code> records and <code class="reqn">J</code>
variables. The OPG method is an asymptotic approximation of
the Hessian, and usually requires fewer calculations with a small
data set, or more with large data sets. Both methods require a
matrix inversion, which becomes costly as dimension grows. The
Richardson-based Hessian method is more accurate, but requires more
calculation in large dimensions. An alternative approach to
obtaining covariance is to use the <code>BayesianBootstrap</code>
on the data, or sample the posterior with iterative quadrature
(<code>IterativeQuadrature</code>), MCMC
(<code>LaplacesDemon</code>), or <code>VariationalBayes</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>sir</code></td>
<td>
<p>This logical argument indicates whether or not Sampling
Importance Resampling (SIR) is conducted via the <code>SIR</code>
function to draw independent posterior samples. This argument
defaults to <code>TRUE</code>. Even when <code>TRUE</code>, posterior samples
are drawn only when <code>LaplaceApproximation</code> has
converged. Posterior samples are required for many other functions,
including <code>plot.laplace</code> and <code>predict.laplace</code>. The only
time that it is advantageous for <code>sir=FALSE</code> is when
<code>LaplaceApproximation</code> is used to help the initial values for
<code>IterativeQuadrature</code>, <code>LaplacesDemon</code>,
<code>PMC</code>, or <code>VariationalBayes</code>, and it is
unnecessary for time to be spent on sampling. Less time can be spent
on sampling by increasing <code>CPUs</code>, which parallelizes the
sampling.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>Stop.Tolerance</code></td>
<td>
<p>This argument accepts any positive number and
defaults to 1.0E-5. Tolerance is calculated each iteration, and the
criteria varies by algorithm. The algorithm is considered to have
converged to the user-specified <code>Stop.Tolerance</code> when the
tolerance is less than or equal to the value of
<code>Stop.Tolerance</code>, and the algorithm terminates at the end of
the current iteration. Often, multiple criteria are used, in
which case the maximum of all criteria becomes the tolerance. For
example, when partial derivatives are taken, it is commonly required
that the Euclidean norm of the partial derivatives is a criterion,
and another common criterion is the Euclidean norm of the
differences between the current and previous parameter values.
Several algorithms have other, specific tolerances.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>CPUs</code></td>
<td>
<p>This argument accepts an integer that specifies the number
of central processing units (CPUs) of the multicore computer or
computer cluster. This argument defaults to <code>CPUs=1</code>, in which
parallel processing does not occur. Parallelization occurs only for
sampling with <code>SIR</code> when <code>sir=TRUE</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>Type</code></td>

<p>This argument specifies the type of parallel processing to
perform, accepting either <code>Type="PSOCK"</code> or

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The Laplace Approximation or Laplace Method is a family of asymptotic
techniques used to approximate integrals. Laplace's method accurately
approximates unimodal posterior moments and marginal posterior
distributions in many cases. Since it is not applicable in
all cases, it is recommended here that Laplace Approximation is used
cautiously in its own right, or preferably, it is used before MCMC.
</p>
<p>After introducing the Laplace Approximation (Laplace, 1774,
p. 366–367), a proof was published later (Laplace, 1814) as part of
a mathematical system of inductive reasoning based on probability.
Laplace used this method to approximate posterior moments.
</p>
<p>Since its introduction, the Laplace Approximation has been applied
successfully in many disciplines. In the 1980s, the Laplace
Approximation experienced renewed interest, especially in statistics,
and some improvements in its implementation were introduced (Tierney
et al., 1986; Tierney et al., 1989). Only since the 1980s has the
Laplace Approximation been seriously considered by statisticians in
practical applications.
</p>
<p>There are many variations of Laplace Approximation, with an effort
toward replacing Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms as the
dominant form of numerical approximation in Bayesian inference. The
run-time of Laplace Approximation is a little longer than Maximum
Likelihood Estimation (MLE), usually shorter than variational Bayes,
and much shorter than MCMC (Azevedo and Shachter, 1994).
</p>
<p>The speed of Laplace Approximation depends on the optimization
algorithm selected, and typically involves many evaluations of the
objective function per iteration (where an MCMC algorithm with a
multivariate proposal usually evaluates once per iteration), making
many MCMC algorithms faster per iteration. The attractiveness
of Laplace Approximation is that it typically improves the objective
function better than iterative quadrature, MCMC, and PMC when the
parameters are in low-probability regions. Laplace Approximation is
also typically faster than MCMC and PMC because it is seeking
point-estimates, rather than attempting to represent the target
distribution with enough simulation draws. Laplace Approximation
extends MLE, but shares similar limitations, such as its asymptotic
nature with respect to sample size and that marginal posterior
distributions are Gaussian. Bernardo and Smith (2000) note that
Laplace Approximation is an attractive family of numerical
approximation algorithms, and will continue to develop.
</p>
<p><code>LaplaceApproximation</code> seeks a global maximum of the logarithm of
the unnormalized joint posterior density. The approach differs by
<code>Method</code>. The <code>LaplacesDemon</code> function uses the
<code>LaplaceApproximation</code> algorithm to optimize initial values and
save time for the user.
</p>
<p>Most optimization algorithms assume that the logarithm of the
unnormalized joint posterior density is defined and differentiable.
Some methods calculate an approximate gradient for each initial value
as the difference in the logarithm of the unnormalized joint posterior
density due to a slight increase in the parameter.
</p>
<p>When <code>Method="AGA"</code>, the direction and distance for each
parameter is proposed based on an approximate truncated gradient and
an adaptive step size. The step size parameter, which is often plural
and called rate parameters in other literature, is adapted each
iteration with the univariate version of the Robbins-Monro stochastic
approximation in Garthwaite (2010). The step size shrinks when a
proposal is rejected and expands when a proposal is accepted.
</p>
<p>Gradient ascent is criticized for sometimes being relatively slow when
close to the maximum, and its asymptotic rate of convergence is
inferior to other methods. However, compared to other popular
optimization algorithms such as Newton-Raphson, an advantage of the
gradient ascent is that it works in infinite dimensions, requiring
only sufficient computer memory. Although Newton-Raphson converges in
fewer iterations, calculating the inverse of the negative Hessian
matrix of second-derivatives is more computationally expensive and
subject to singularities. Therefore, gradient ascent takes longer to
converge, but is more generalizable.
</p>
<p>When <code>Method="BFGS"</code>, the BFGS algorithm is used, which was
proposed by Broyden (1970), Fletcher (1970), Goldfarb (1970), and
Shanno (1970), independently. BFGS may be the most efficient and
popular quasi-Newton optimiziation algorithm. As a quasi-Newton
algorithm, the Hessian matrix is approximated using rank-one updates
specified by (approximate) gradient evaluations. Since BFGS is very
popular, there are many variations of it. This is a version by Nash
that has been adapted from the Rvmmin package, and is used in the
<code>optim</code> function of base R. The approximate Hessian is not
guaranteed to converge to the Hessian. When BFGS is used, the
approximate Hessian is not used to calculate the final covariance
matrix.
</p>
<p>When <code>Method="BHHH"</code>, the algorithm of Berndt et al. (1974) is
used, which is commonly pronounced B-triple H. The BHHH algorithm is a
quasi-Newton method that includes a step-size parameter, partial
derivatives, and an approximation of a covariance matrix that is
calculated as the inverse of the sum of the outer product of the
gradient (OPG), calculated from each record. The OPG method becomes
more costly with data sets with more records. Since partial
derivatives must be calculated per record of data, the list of data
has special requirements with this method, and must include design
matrix <code>X</code>, and dependent variable <code>y</code> or <code>Y</code>. Records
must be row-wise. An advantage of BHHH over NR (see below) is that
the covariance matrix is necessarily positive definite, and gauranteed
to provide an increase in LP each iteration (given a small enough
step-size), even in convex areas. The covariance matrix is better
approximated with larger data sample sizes, and when closer to the
maximum of LP. Disadvantages of BHHH include that it can give small
increases in LP, especially when far from the maximum or when LP is
highly non-quadratic.
</p>
<p>When <code>Method="CG"</code>, a nonlinear conjugate gradient algorithm is
used. CG uses partial derivatives, but does not use the Hessian matrix
or any approximation of it. CG usually requires more iterations to
reach convergence than other algorithms that use the Hessian or an
approximation. However, since the Hessian becomes computationally
expensive as the dimension of the model grows, CG is applicable to
large dimensional models when <code>CovEst="Hessian"</code> is avoided.
CG was originally developed by Hestenes and Stiefel (1952), though
this version is adapted from the <code>Rcgminu</code> function in package
Rcgmin.
</p>
<p>When <code>Method="DFP"</code>, the Davidon-Fletcher-Powell algorithm is
used. DFP was the first popular, multidimensional, quasi-Newton
optimization algorithm. The DFP update of an approximate Hessian
matrix maintains symmetry and positive-definiteness. The approximate
Hessian is not guaranteed to converge to the Hessian. When DFP is
used, the approximate Hessian is not used to calculate the final
covariance matrix. Although DFP is very effective, it was superseded
by the BFGS algorithm.
</p>
<p>When <code>Method="HAR"</code>, a hit-and-run algorithm with a multivariate
proposal and adaptive length is used. The length parameter is adapted
each iteration with the univariate version of the Robbins-Monro
stochastic approximation in Garthwaite (2010). The length shrinks when
a proposal is rejected and expands when a proposal is accepted. This
is the same algorithm as the HARM or Hit-And-Run Metropolis MCMC
algorithm with adaptive length, except that a Metropolis step is not
used.
</p>
<p>When <code>Method="HJ"</code>, the Hooke-Jeeves (1961) algorithm is used.
This was adapted from the <code>HJK</code> algorithm in package dfoptim.
Hooke-Jeeves is a derivative-free, direct search method. Each iteration
involves two steps: an exploratory move and a pattern move. The
exploratory move explores local behavior, and the pattern move takes
advantage of pattern direction. It is sometimes described as a
hill-climbing algorithm. If the solution improves, it accepts the
move, and otherwise rejects it. Step size decreases with each
iteration. The decreasing step size can trap it in local maxima, where
it gets stuck and convergences erroneously. Users are encouraged to
attempt again after what seems to be convergence, starting from the
latest point. Although getting stuck at local maxima can be
problematic, the Hooke-Jeeves algorithm is also attractive because it
is simple, fast, does not depend on derivatives, and is otherwise
relatively robust.
</p>
<p>When <code>Method="LBFGS"</code>, the limited-memory BFGS
(Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno) algorithm is called in
<code>optim</code>, once per iteration.
</p>
<p>When <code>Method="LM"</code>, the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm (Levenberg,
1944; Marquardt, 1963) is used. Also known as the Levenberg-Marquardt
Algorithm (LMA) or the Damped Least-Squares (DLS) method, LM is a
trust region (not to be confused with TR below) quasi-Newton
optimization algorithm that provides minimizes nonlinear least
squares, and has been adapted here to maximize LP. LM uses partial
derivatives and approximates the Hessian with outer-products. It is
suitable for nonlinear optimization up to a few hundred parameters,
but loses its efficiency in larger problems due to matrix inversion.
LM is considered between the Gauss-Newton algorithm and gradient
descent. When far from the solution, LM moves slowly like gradient
descent, but is guaranteed to converge. When LM is close to the
solution, LM becomes a damped Gauss-Newton method. This was adapted
from the <code>lsqnonlin</code> algorithm in package pracma.
</p>
<p>When <code>Method="NM"</code>, the Nelder-Mead (1965) algorithm is
used. This was adapted from the <code>nelder_mead</code> function in package
pracma. Nelder-Mead is a derivative-free, direct search method that is
known to become inefficient in large-dimensional problems. As the
dimension increases, the search direction becomes increasingly
orthogonal to the steepest ascent (usually descent)
direction. However, in smaller dimensions, it is a popular algorithm.
At each iteration, three steps are taken to improve a simplex:
reflection, extension, and contraction.
</p>
<p>When <code>Method="NR"</code>, the Newton-Raphson optimization algorithm,
also known as Newton's Method, is used. Newton-Raphson uses
derivatives and a Hessian matrix. The algorithm is included for its
historical significance, but is known to be problematic when starting
values are far from the targets, and calculating and inverting the
Hessian matrix can be computationally expensive. As programmed here,
when the Hessian is problematic, it tries to use only the derivatives,
and when that fails, a jitter is applied. Newton-Raphson should not
be the first choice of the user, and BFGS should always be preferred.
</p>
<p>When <code>Method="PSO"</code>, the Standard Particle Swarm Optimization
2007 algorithm is used. A swarm of particles is moved according
to velocity, neighborhood, and the best previous solution. The
neighborhood for each particle is a set of informing particles. PSO
is derivative-free. PSO has been adapted from the <code>psoptim</code>
function in package pso.
</p>
<p>When <code>Method="Rprop"</code>, the approximate gradient is taken for each
parameter in each iteration, and its sign is compared to the
approximate gradient in the previous iteration. A weight element in a
weight vector is associated with each approximate gradient. A weight
element is multiplied by 1.2 when the sign does not change, or by 0.5
if the sign changes. The weight vector is the step size, and is
constrained to the interval [0.001, 50], and initial weights are
0.0125. This is the resilient backpropagation algorithm, which is
often denoted as the “Rprop-” algorithm of Riedmiller (1994).
</p>
<p>When <code>Method="SGD"</code>, a stochastic gradient descent algorithm is
used that is designed only for big data, and gained popularity after
successful use in the NetFlix competition. This algorithm has special
requirements for the <code>Model</code> specification function and the
<code>Data</code> list. See the “LaplacesDemon Tutorial” vignette for more
information.
</p>
<p>When <code>Method="SOMA"</code>, a population of ten particles or
individuals moves in the direction of the best particle, the leader.
The leader does not move in each iteration, and a line-search is used
for each non-leader, up to three times the difference in parameter
values between each non-leader and leader. This algorithm is
derivative-free and often considered in the family of evolution
algorithms. Numerous model evaluations are performed per non-leader
per iteration. This algorithm was adapted from package soma.
</p>
<p>When <code>Method="SPG"</code>, a Spectral Projected Gradient algorithm
is used. SPG is a non-monotone algorithm that is suitable for
high-dimensional models. The approximate gradient is used, but the
Hessian matrix is not. When used with large models,
<code>CovEst="Hessian"</code> should be avoided. SPG has been adapted from
the <code>spg</code> function in package BB.
</p>
<p>When <code>Method="SR1"</code>, the Symmetric Rank-One (SR1) algorithm is
used. SR1 is a quasi-Newton algorithm, and the Hessian matrix is
approximated, often without being positive-definite. At the posterior
modes, the true Hessian is usually positive-definite, but this is
often not the case during optimization when the parameters have not
yet reached the posterior modes. Other restrictions, including
constraints, often result in the true Hessian being indefinite at the
solution. For these reasons, SR1 often outperforms BFGS. The
approximate Hessian is not guaranteed to converge to the Hessian. When
SR1 is used, the approximate Hessian is not used to calculate the
final covariance matrix.
</p>
<p>When <code>Method="TR"</code>, the Trust Region algorithm of Nocedal and
Wright (1999) is used. The TR algorithm attempts to reach its
objective in the fewest number of iterations, is therefore very
efficient, as well as safe. The efficiency of TR is attractive when
model evaluations are expensive. The Hessian is approximated each
iteration, making TR best suited to models with small to medium
dimensions, say up to a few hundred parameters. TR has been adapted
from the <code>trust</code> function in package trust.
