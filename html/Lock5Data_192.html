<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The data come from a study to see if transfusions of blood plasma from young mice (equivalent to about a 25-year-old person) can counteract or reverse brain aging in old mice (equivalent to about a 70-year-old person.)  Old mice were randomly assigned to receive plasma from either a young mice or another old mouse, and exercise endurance was measured.
