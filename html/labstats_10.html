<h2>Repeated measures data on rat muscles</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Repeated measures data set from Kristensen and Hansen
(2004) testing the effect of pinacidil on the force of muscle
contraction.
</p>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 210 rows and 4 variables:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>time:</dt>
<dd>
<p>Observation number, from 0 to 14. Observations were
taken every 30 seconds.</p>
</dd>
<dt>cond:</dt>
<dd>
<p>Condition, either Placebo or Pinacidil.</p>
</dd>
<dt>rat:</dt>
<dd>
<p>Rat identification number.</p>
</dd>
<dt>values:</dt>
<dd>
<p>Force of muscle contraction, normalised to the
first time point.</p>
</dd>  </dl>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Seven rats were euthanized and both soleus muscles (lower
leg) were extracted from each rat. One muscle from each pair was
randomised to the pinacidil condition and the other to the control
condition. Fifteen measurements of the force of muscle contraction
were taken every thirty seconds on each muscle.
