<h2>R API to LocalSolver</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The package converts R data onto input and data for
LocalSolver, executes optimization and exposes optimization
results as R data.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p><em>LocalSolver</em> (<a href="http://www.localsolver.com/">http://www.localsolver.com/</a>) is
an optimization engine developed by <em>Innovation24</em>
(<a href="http://www.innovation24.fr/">http://www.innovation24.fr/</a>). It is designed to
solve large-scale mixed-variable non-convex optimization
problems.
</p>
<p>The localsolver package is result of cooperation of
<em>WLOG Solutions</em>
(<a href="http://www.wlogsolutions.com/en/">http://www.wlogsolutions.com/en/</a>) in collaboration
Decision Support and Analysis Division at <em>Warsaw
School of Economics</em> (<a href="http://www.sgh.waw.pl/en/">http://www.sgh.waw.pl/en/</a>).
</p>
<p>The localsolver package allows for solving optimization
problems in R by using the LocalSolver program. It combines
efficiency and easiness of model formulation, which
characterize the LocalSolver program, with the elasticity
of data in R. The model formulation in LSP language is
provided by a user as a string or text file, and the input
data - as a list. The solution is also a list, with chosen
decision variables, constraints and objective function
values. Thus the problem can be solved many times (for
example, by iterating with different parameter settings)
and the result is provided in a form which makes further
processing or visualization in R fast and easy.
</p>
<p>It is highly recommended that the LocalSolver software is
installed before the R package.<br> The test version
(limited to 100 decisions and 1000 variables) can be
downloaded from the website:
<a href="http://www.localsolver.com/download.html">http://www.localsolver.com/download.html</a><br> The
access to the trial license for full version requires
contacting the <em>Innovation24</em> company. For further

looking forward for any future package development
suggestions.
