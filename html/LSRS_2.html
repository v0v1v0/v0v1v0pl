<h2> Enhanced Built-Up and Bareness Index </h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p> Enhanced Built-Up and Bareness Index (EBBI):
The EBBI is a remote sensing index that applies bands of NIR, SWIR, and TIR.    The NIR and SWIR bands are associated with a high contrast level for            detecting built-up and bare land areas In addition, in these bands, there is    an inverse reflectance ratio with respect to detecting built-up or bare land    areas compared to vegetation. Vegetation has a high reflectance in NIR band,    but the reflectance of built-up or bare land in NIR band is low. subtraction    of NIR band  from SWIR band  will result in positive values for built-up and    barren pixels and will result in negative values for vegetation.
In addition, a summation of SWIR band  and TIR band  will result in higher      values pixel for built-up and bare land than for vegetation. The difference     between the subtraction of NIR band  from SWIR band  and the summation of       SWIR band  and TIR band  will result in virtually 0 water pixels as well as     negative values for vegetation and positive values for built-up and barren      pixels. This outcome allows for easy distinguishing between built-up and bare    land areas.EBBI can be calculated as:
</p>
<p>EBBI=SWIR-Red/10*sqrt(SWIR+TIR)
</p>
