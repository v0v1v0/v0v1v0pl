<h2>Get default number of threads used by LightGBM</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>LightGBM attempts to speed up many operations by using multi-threading.
The number of threads used in those operations can be controlled via the
<code>num_threads</code> parameter passed through <code>params</code> to functions like
lgb.train and lgb.Dataset. However, some operations (like materializing
a model from a text file) are done via code paths that don't explicitly accept thread-control
configuration.
</p>
<p>Use this function to see the default number of threads LightGBM will use for such operations.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">getLGBMthreads()
</code></pre>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>number of threads as an integer. <code>-1</code> means that in situations where parameter <code>num_threads</code> is
not explicitly supplied, LightGBM will choose a number of threads to use automatically.
</p>
