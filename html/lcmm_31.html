<h2>Simulated dataset for lcmm and Jointlcmm functions</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The data were simulated from a joint latent class mixed model with 3
classes.  Repeated data of 3 longitudinal outcomes (Ydep1, Ydep2, Ydep3) and
censored time of event (Tevent, Event) with delayed entry (Tentry) were
simulated for a total of 300 subjects.  The three latent classes were
predicted by the continuous covariate X3.  In each latent class, the
longitudinal outcome Ydep1 followed a linear mixed model including
intercept, time and squared time both with correlated random-effects and
class-specific fixed effects. In addition, the binary covariate X1 and its
interaction with time X1:Time had a common impact (over classes) on the
Ydep1 trajectory.  The longitudinal ordinal outcomes Ydep2 and Ydep3 were
generated from Ydep1 using threshold models with respectively 30 and 10
thresholds.  In each latent class, the time of event followed a
class-specific Weibull hazard with a common proportional effect of the
binary covariate X2. Both time of entry Tentry and time of censoring had a
uniform distribution
