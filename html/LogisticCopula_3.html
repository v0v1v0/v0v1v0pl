<h2>Example data set</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This radar data was collected by a system in Goose Bay, Labrador. 
This system consists of a phased array of 16 high-frequency antennas with a 
total transmitted power on the order of 6.4 kilowatts. 
See Sigillito, V. G., Wing, S. P., Hutton, L. V., &amp; Baker, K. B. (1989) 
for more details. The targets were free electrons in the ionosphere. "Good"
radar returns are those showing evidence of some type of structure in the
ionosphere.  "Bad" returns are those that do not; their signals pass through
the ionosphere.
