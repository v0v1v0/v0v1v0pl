<p>Description from Dray et al. (2014): Community composition of vascular
plants was determined in 75 5 × 5 m plots. Each site was
described by six environmental variables: mean snowmelt
date over the period 1997–1999, slope inclination, aspect,
index of microscale landform, index of physical disturbance
due to cryoturbation and solifluction, and an index of
zoogenic disturbance due to trampling and burrowing activities
of the Alpine marmot. All variables are quantitative except
the landform and zoogenic disturbance indices that are
categorical variables with five and three categories,
respectively. Eight quantitative functional traits (i.e.,
vegetative height, lateral spread, leaf elevation angle,
leaf area, leaf thickness, specific leaf area, mass-based
leaf nitrogen content, and seed mass) were measured on the
82 most abundant plant species (out of a total of 132
recorded species).
