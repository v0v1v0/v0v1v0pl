<h2>Sentence corpus - train part</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This corpus contains sentences from
the abstract and introduction of 30 scientific articles that have been
annotated (i.e. labeled or tagged) according to a modified version of the
Argumentative Zones annotation scheme.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">train_sentences
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>2 data frame with 3117 rows and 2 variables:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>text</dt>
<dd>
<p>the sentences as a character vector</p>
</dd>
<dt>class.text</dt>
<dd>
<p>the category of the sentence</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>These 30 scientific articles come
from three different domains:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p> PLoS Computational Biology (PLOS)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> The machine learning repository on arXiv (ARXIV)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> The psychology journal Judgment and Decision Making (JDM)
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>There are 10 articles from each domain. In addition to the labeled data, this
corpus also contains a corresponding set of unlabeled articles. These unlabeled
articles also come from PLOS, ARXIV, and JDM. There are 300 unlabeled articles
from each domain (again, only the sentences from the abstract and
introduction). These unlabeled articles can be used for unsupervised or
semi-supervised approaches to sentence classification which rely on a small set
of labeled data and a larger set of unlabeled data.
