<h3>Details</h3>

<p><code>formula</code> is interpreted differently depending on whether <code>method</code>
is <code>"URI"</code> or <code>"MRI"</code>. When <code>method = "URI"</code>, the formula is
taken literally as the right-hand side of the outcome model formula. The
only difference is that the covariates will be centered based on the
argument to <code>estimand</code> (see below). When <code>method = "MRI"</code>, all
references to the treatment are removed (i.e., covariate interactions with
treatment become covariate main effects if not already present), and the new
formula is taken as the right-hand side of the model formula fit within each
treatment group. This is equivalent to allowing all covariates to have both
main effects and interactions with treatment after centering the covariates
based on the argument to <code>estimand</code>. Allowing the treatment to interact
with all covariates with <code>method = "URI"</code> is equivalent to specifying
<code>method = "MRI"</code>, and, for binary treatments, the returned weights will
be the same when <code>fixef = NULL</code>.
</p>
<p>When any treatment-by-covariate interactions are present in <code>formula</code>
or when <code>method = "MRI"</code>, covariates are centered at specific values to
ensure the resulting weights correspond to the desired estimand as supplied
to the <code>estimand</code> argument. For the ATE, the covariates are centered at
their means in the full sample. For the ATT and ATC, the covariates are
centered at their means in the treatment or control group (i.e., the
<code>focal</code> group), respectively. For the CATE, the covariates are centered
according to the argument supplied to <code>target</code> (see below). Note that
when covariate-by-covariate interactions are present, they will be centered
after computing the interaction rather than the interaction being computed
on the centered covariates unless <code>estimand = "CATE"</code>, in which case
the covariates will be centered at the values specified in <code>target</code>
prior to involvement in interactions.
</p>


<h4>Estimating a CATE</h4>

<p>When <code>estimand = "CATE"</code>, <code>target</code> can be supplied either as a
single target profile (i.e., a list or a data frame with one row) or as a
target dataset, potentially with its own sampling weights, which are
supplied to <code>target.weights</code>. The variables included in <code>target</code>
must correspond to all the named <em>covariates</em> in <code>formula</code>; for
example, if <code>formula = ~ X1 + log(X1) + X2 + X1:X2</code>, values in
<code>target</code> must be given for <code>X1</code> and <code>X2</code>, but not
<code>log(X1)</code> or <code>X1:X2</code>. To choose a target profile value for a
factor corresponding to a proportion (e.g., a target value of .5 for a
variable like <code>sex</code> indicating a target population with a 50-50 sex
split), the factor variable must be split into a numeric variable
beforehand, e.g., using <code>model.matrix()</code> or
<code>cobalt::splitfactor()</code>. <code>target</code> values cannot be given to
variables specified using <code>$</code>, <code style="white-space: pre;">⁠[[]]⁠</code>, or <code style="white-space: pre;">⁠[]⁠</code> (e.g.,
<code>data$X1</code>), so an error will be thrown if they are used in
<code>formula</code>. When a target dataset is supplied, covariates will be
centered at their means in the (<code>target.weights</code>-weighted) target
dataset.
</p>



<h4>Base weights and sampling weights</h4>

<p>Base weights (<code>base.weights</code>) and sampling weights (<code>s.weights</code>)
are similar in that they both involve combining weights with an outcome
regression model. However, they differ in a few ways. Sampling weights are
primarily used to adjust the target population; when the outcome model is
fit, it is fit using weighted least squares, and when target balance is
assessed, it is assessed using the sampling weighted population as the
target population. Centering of covariates in the outcome model is done
using the sampling weighted covariate means. Base weights are primarily used
to offer a second level of balancing beyond the implied regression weights;
they can be incorporated into the effect estimate either using weighted
least squares or using the augmented inverse probability weighting (AIPW)
estimator. Base weights do not change the target population, so when target
balance is assessed, it is assessed using the unweighted population as the
target population.
</p>
<p>Some forms of weights both change the target population and provide an extra
layer of balancing, like propensity score weights that target estimands
other than the ATT, ATC, or ATE (e.g., overlap weights), or matching weights
where the target population is defined by the matching (e.g., matching with
a caliper, cardinality matching, or coarsened exact matching). Because these
weights change the target population, they should be supplied to
<code>s.weights</code> to ensure covariates are appropriately centered. When there
are no treatment-by-covariate interactions and <code>method = "URI"</code>,
whether weights are supplied to <code>base.weights</code> or <code>s.weights</code> will
not matter for the estimation of the weights but will affect the target
population in balance assessment.
</p>
<p>When both <code>base.weights</code> and <code>s.weights</code> are supplied, e.g., when
the base weights are the result of a propensity score model fit with
sampling weights, it is assumed the base weights do not incorporate the
sampling weights; that is, it is assumed that to estimate a treatment effect
<em>without</em> regression adjustment, the base weights and the sampling
weights would have to be multiplied together. This is true, for example, for
the weights in a <code>matchit</code> or <code>weightit</code> object (see below) but
not for weights in the output of <code>MatchIt::match.data()</code> unless called
with <code>include.s.weights = FALSE</code> or weights resulting from
<code>CBPS::CBPS()</code>.
</p>



<h4>Regression after using <span class="pkg">MatchIt</span> or <span class="pkg">WeightIt</span>
</h4>

<p>Regression weights can be computed in a matched or weighted sample by
supplying a <code>matchit</code> or <code>weightit</code> object (from <span class="pkg">MatchIt</span> or
<span class="pkg">WeightIt</span>, respectively) to the <code>obj</code> argument of <code>lmw()</code>.
The estimand, focal group (if any), base weights, and sampling weights (if any) will be taken from
the supplied object and used in the calculation of the implied regression
weights, unless these have been supplied separately to <code>lmw()</code>. The
<code>weights</code> component of the supplied object containing the matching or
balancing weights will be passed to <code>base.weights</code> and the
<code>s.weights</code> component will be passed to <code>s.weights</code>. Arguments
supplied to <code>lmw()</code> will take precedence over the corresponding
components in the <code>obj</code> object.
</p>



<h4>Multi-category treatments</h4>

<p>There are a few differences when the
treatment has multiple (i.e., more than 2) categories. If <code>estimand</code> is
<code>"ATT"</code> or <code>"ATC"</code>, an argument should be supplied to <code>focal</code>
identifying which group is the treated or control (i.e., "focal") group,
respectively.
</p>
<p>The key difference, though, is when <code>method = "URI"</code>, because in this
case the contrast between each pair of treatment groups has its own weights
and its own implied target population. Because <code>lmw()</code> only produces
one set of weights, an argument must be supplied to <code>contrast</code>
identifying which groups are to be used as the contrast for computing the
weights. In addition, to compute the treatment effect corresponding to the
chosen contrast as a weighted difference in outcome means, the difference
must be taken between the weighted mean of the non-reference group and the
weighted mean of <em>all other groups combined</em>, rather than simply the
weighted mean of the reference group.
</p>
<p>The implication of this is that contrast statistics computed in the weighted
sample involve all units, even those not in the contrasted groups, whereas
statistics computed in the unweighted sample only involve units in the
contrasted groups. See <code>summary.lmw()</code> for more information on
assessing balance using the regression weights for multi-category
treatments. Given these complications, it is generally best to use
<code>method = "MRI"</code> with multi-category treatments.
</p>



<h4>Fixed effects</h4>

<p>A fixed effects variable can be supplied to the
<code>fixef</code> argument. This is equivalent to adding the fixed effects
variable as a predictor that does not interact with the treatment or any
other covariate. The difference is that computation is much faster when the
fixed effect has many levels because demeaning is used rather than including
the fixed effect variable as a collection of dummy variables. When using
URI, the weights will be the same regardless of whether the fixed effect
variable is included as a covariate or supplied to <code>fixef</code>; when using
MRI, results will differ because the fixed effect variable does not interact
with treatment. The fixed effects variable will not appear in the
<code>summary.lmw()</code> output (but can be added using <code>addlvariables</code>
argument) or in the model output of <code>lmw_est()</code> or
<code>summary.lmw_est()</code>. Because it does not interact with the
treatment, the distribution of the fixed effect variable may not correspond
to the target population, so caution should be used if it is expected the
treatment effect varies across levels of this variable (in which case it
should be included as a predictor). Currently only one fixed effect variable
is allowed.
