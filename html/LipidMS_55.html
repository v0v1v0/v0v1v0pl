<h3>Details</h3>

<p><code>idAcylCerneg</code> function involves 5 steps. 1) FullMS-based
identification of candidate AcylCer as M-H and M+CH3COO. 2) Search of AcylCer 
class fragments: no class fragments by default. 3) Search of specific fragments 
that inform about the acyl chain (Cer as M-H), the sphingoid base (neutral 
loss of 62.0600 of the Sph) and the FA chain (FA as M-H and M-H2O but with a N 
instead of an O, what results in a mass differences of 1.9918 and 19.0179 
respectively). 4) Look for possible chains structure based on the combination 
of chain fragments. 5) Check intensity rules to confirm chains position. In 
this case, the fragment coming from the loss of the acyl chain must be at least 
5 times more intense the fragment from the sphingoid base and this one, two 
times more intense than the FA chain from sn3.
</p>
<p>Results data frame shows: ID, lipid class, CDB (total number
of carbons and double bounds), FA composition (specific chains composition if
it has been confirmed), mz, RT (in seconds), I (intensity, which comes
directly from de input), Adducts, ppm (mz error), confidenceLevel (Subclass,
FA level, where chains are known but not their positions, or FA position
level) and Score (parent-fragment coelution score mean in DIA data or relative 
sum intensity in DDA of all fragments used for the identification).
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>annotated msobject (list with several elements). The results element
is a data frame that shows: ID, lipid class, CDB (total number of carbons
and double bounds), FA composition (specific chains composition if it has
been confirmed), mz, RT (in seconds), I (intensity), Adducts, ppm (mz error),
confidenceLevel (Subclass, FA level, where chains are known but not their
positions, or FA position level), peakID, and Score (parent-fragment coelution 
score mean in DIA data or relative sum intensity in DDA of all fragments used 
for the identification).
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>This function has been writen based on fragmentation patterns
observed for three different platforms (QTOF 6550 from Agilent, Synapt G2-Si
from Waters and Q-exactive from Thermo), but it may need to be customized for
other platforms or acquisition settings.
