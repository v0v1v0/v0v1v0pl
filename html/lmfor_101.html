<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The data are based on a long-term thinning experiment on a naturally regenerated
Scots pine stand in Eastern Finland, see documentation of afterthin and patti for details. 
The experiment consists of 10
sample plots, in four different classes (including an unthinned control) according
to the post-thinning stand density. The plots were thinned in winter 1986-1987. 
The undisturbed growth for each tree was predicted using a linear mixed-effect 
model with crossed year and tree effect, which was fitted to a data set including the control 
treatment for all calendar years and other trees until the year of thinning. 
The thinning effect was computed as the difference of observed growth and the undisturbed predicted growth. 
For details about the procedure used 
in extracting the thinning effect, see Example 6.6 in Mehtatalo and Lappi 2020b and for nonlinear modeling of this data, see Chapter 7 of Mehtatalo and Lappi 2020a.
The data includes only the observations after the thinning year for the tree thinned treatments (i.e., control is excluded).
