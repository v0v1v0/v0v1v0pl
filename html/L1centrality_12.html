<h2>Multiscale Edge Representation</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Derives a multiscale edge representation. Each vertex is connected to its
local median, which is found in its
<i>L</i><sub>1</sub> centrality-based
neighborhood.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">L1centEDGE(g, eta, alpha)

## S3 method for class 'igraph'
L1centEDGE(g, eta = NULL, alpha)

## S3 method for class 'matrix'
L1centEDGE(g, eta = NULL, alpha)

## S3 method for class 'L1centEDGE'
print(x, ...)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>g</code></td>
<td>
<p>An <code>igraph</code> graph object or a distance matrix. The graph must
be undirected and connected. Equivalently, the distance matrix must be
symmetric, and all entries must be finite.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>eta</code></td>
<td>
<p>An optional nonnegative multiplicity (weight) vector for (vertex)
weighted networks. The sum of its components must be positive. If set to
<code>NULL</code> (the default), all vertices will have the same positive weight
(multiplicity) of 1, i.e., <code>g</code> is treated as a vertex unweighted graph. The
length of the <code>eta</code> must be equivalent to the number of vertices.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>alpha</code></td>
<td>
<p>A number or a numeric vector of locality levels. Values
must be between 0 and 1.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>An <code>L1centEDGE</code> object, obtained as a result of the function
<code>L1centEDGE()</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>...</code></td>
<td>
<p>Further arguments passed to or from other methods. This argument
is ignored here.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>In a global perspective, any given undirected graph can be represented as a
star-shaped directed graph, with each vertex making a connection to the
median vertex. Based on this idea, an undirected graph can be represented as
a directed graph, with each vertex making a connection to the <em>local</em>
median vertex. The local median vertex of, say, <code class="reqn">v_i</code>, is defined as a
median vertex among the
<i>L</i><sub>1</sub> centrality-based
neighborhood of <code class="reqn">v_i</code>. By varying the level of locality, the given graph
can be visually inspected at multiple scales. Refer to Kang and Oh (2024) for
details.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p><code>L1centEDGE()</code> returns an object of class <code>L1centEDGE</code>. It
is a list of ‘edge lists’. The length of the list is equivalent to
the length of <code>alpha</code>, and the names of the list are the values of
<code>alpha</code>. The <code>i</code>th component of the list is a 2-column matrix,
and each row defines one directed edge, i.e., it is an edge list. The
second column is the local (level <code>alpha[i]</code>) median of the vertex at
the first column. There may be more than one edge from each vertex, since
there may be more than one local median.
</p>
<p><code>print.L1centEDGE()</code> prints the edge lists and returns them invisibly.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>The function is valid only for undirected and connected graphs.
