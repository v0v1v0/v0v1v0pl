<h3>Description</h3>

<p>BinaryNet
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Rcpp_DirectedNet and Rcpp_UndirectedNet are the native network classes for the
lolog package. They are designed for algorithmic performance, and are thin wrappers
for an underlying C++ object. These network objects can be passed back and forth between
R and C++ with little overhead. Because they are pointers to C++ objects, serialization
via 'save' or 'dput' are not supported
