<h2>Swap Name Labels for Variable Names</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Replace data.frame variable names with their corresponding name labels
(previously assigned using <code>add_name_labs</code>).
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">use_name_labs(data, vars = NULL)

unl(data, vars = NULL)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>data</code></td>
<td>
<p>the data.frame whose name labels you wish to "use" (aka swap,
turn on, activate, etc.).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>vars</code></td>
<td>
<p>the names of the columns (variables) to which name labels will be
applied. If NULL, all available name labels will be swapped in for the
corresponding variable (column) names.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Note: <code>unl</code> is a compact alias for <code>use_name_labs</code>: they do the same thing,
and the former is easier to type
</p>
<p><code>use_name_labs</code> works with <code>add_name_labs</code>, <code>get_name_labs</code>, <code>use_var_names</code>,
and <code>drop_name_labs</code>, to facilitate the creation, accessing, substitution
(swap out, swap back in), and  destruction of variable name labels for
variable names. Each variable (column) of a data.frame can receive one and
only one "name label," which typically is a noun phrase that expounds the
meaning of contents of the variable's name (e.g., "Weight in ounces at birth"
might be a name label for a column called "wgt"). <code>add_name_labs</code> associates
these labels with variables in a data.frame, <code>use_name_labs</code> applies or
"turns on" those name labels, i.e., swaps out variable names for
corresponding labels, and you can assign the name-label-swapped data.frame
to an object, or you may use it strictly for display purposes (e.g.,
head(use_name_labs(df), 5)). Because they are intended to be more descriptive
than column names, they tend to be more verbose â€“ possibly so verbose as to
undermine their value or convenience for anything other than an on-demand
"What is this variable again?" cheat sheet via get_name_labs(). That said,
this may have some uses (see examples).

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A data.frame, with (all or the select) name labels swapped in for
the variable names.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R"># variable names and their labels
names_labs_vec &lt;- c(
  "mpg" = "Miles/(US) gallon",
  "cyl" = "Number of cylinders",
  "disp" = "Displacement (cu.in.)",
  "hp" = "Gross horsepower",
  "drat" = "Rear axle ratio",
  "wt" = "Weight (1000 lbs)",
  "qsec" = "1/4 mile time",
  "vs" = "Engine (0 = V-shaped, 1 = straight)",
  "am" = "Transmission (0 = automatic, 1 = manual)",
  "gear" = "Number of forward gears",
  "carb" = "Number of carburetors"
)

# add the above name labeling scheme
mt2 &lt;- add_name_labs(mtcars, name.labs = names_labs_vec)

# use the name labeling scheme (i.e., swap out column/variable names for
# ...their name labels)
mt2 &lt;- use_name_labs(mt2)

# compare these two - concision vs. informativeness
as.data.frame(sapply(mtcars, mean))
as.data.frame(sapply(mt2, mean))

# compare the plot labeling we get with mtcars
with(mtcars, hist(mpg))

get_name_labs(mt2) # get the lab of interest, and paste it into `` below
with(mt2, hist(`Miles/(US) gallon`))

# regression - this is easier to type
lm(mpg ~ cyl, data = mtcars)

# regression with name labs - more painful to type/copy-paste, but may be
# ...the more informative labels are worth it (your mileage/mpg may vary)
# let's see the name labels, then copy paste mpg and cyl labs from console to
# ...where we need them in the lm() call
get_name_labs(mt2) # copy from this call's console output
lm(`Miles/(US) gallon` ~ `Number of cylinders`, data = mt2) # paste into `` here

# same results, more informative labels, more steps/hand-jamming pain
# can also turn them on (semi) permanently
# ...then you can use mt2$ syntax in RStudio, and RStudio will autocomplete,
# then you can backspace delete the "mt2$"
# if you like
mt2 &lt;- use_name_labs(mt2)
lm(`Miles/(US) gallon` ~ `Number of cylinders`, data = mt2)
lm(mpg ~ cyl, data = use_var_names(mt2))

# let's turn them back off
mt2 &lt;- use_var_names(mt2) # use_var_names() as "undo" of use_name_labs()

# back to our previous variable names
head(mt2)
# even with name labels "off," mt2 retains labelr attribute meta-data
# ...which we can strip away using strip_labs()
identical(strip_labs(mt2), mtcars) # and we're back
