<h2>Verbatim Environments</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Text within a verbatim block appears exactly as type, 
including whitespace.  This is useful when inserting code into a document
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">lazy.verbatim.end()

lazy.verbatim.start()
</code></pre>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>A verbatim block takes any text entered and typsets it exactly as it was entered.  
White space is preserved and the font changes.  This is typically done to display
code, since the whitespace may preserve readability.
</p>
<p>For HTML documents, this is done by opening a "&lt;p ...&gt;" tag with font family "monospace" and 
font "courier".  These are applicable until <code>lazy.verbatim.end</code> is called and the 
"&lt;/p&gt;" tag is placed, closing the verbatim environment.
</p>
<p>It should be noted that HTML code in this forced environment will still not render whitespace as in the
LaTeX verbatim environment.  This can be enforced by running the text in the environment through a function
like <code>gsub(" ", "&amp;nbsp ", [text])</code> (<code>&amp;nbsp</code> is the HTML character for a non-breaking space).
