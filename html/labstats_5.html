<h2>Mouse liver enzyme randomised block design data set</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Sixteen mice from four strains were used; half were
assigned to the treated condition and half to the control. The
experiment was split into two batches, which were run two months
apart.
</p>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 16 rows and 4 variables:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>strain:</dt>
<dd>
<p>Four strains of mice were used: NIH, BALB/c, A/J,
and 129/Ola.</p>
</dd>
<dt>treatment:</dt>
<dd>
<p>Presence or absence of diallyl sulphide.</p>
</dd>
<dt>batch:</dt>
<dd>
<p>The experiment was conducted in two batches.</p>
</dd>
<dt>value:</dt>
<dd>
<p>Levels of glutathione-S-transferase (Gst).</p>
</dd>  </dl>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The purpose of the experiment was to test if diallyl
sulphide (DS) affects the activity of the liver enzyme Gst. Four
strains of mice were used and the experiment was conducted in two
batches, where the housing conditions differed between
batches. Both batch and strain are considered blocking variables.
