<h2>Hangartner's Convergence Diagnostic</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Hangartner et al. (2011) proposed a convergence diagnostic for
discrete Markov chains. A simple Pearson's Chi-squared test for
two or more non-overlapping periods of a discrete Markov chain
is a reliable diagnostic of convergence. It does not rely upon the
estimation of spectral density, on suspect normality assumptions, or
determining overdispersion within a small number of outcomes, all of
which can be problematic with discrete measures. A discrete Markov
chain is split into two or more non-overlapping windows. Two windows
are recommended, and results may be sensitive to the number of
selected windows, as well as sample size. As such, a user may try
several window configurations before concluding there is no evidence
of non-convergence.
</p>
<p>As the number of discrete events in the sample space increases, this
diagnostic becomes less appropriate and standard diagnostics become
more appropriate.

<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">Hangartner.Diagnostic(x, J=2)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>This required argument is a vector of marginal posterior
samples of a discrete Markov chain, such as selected from the output
of <code>LaplacesDemon</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>J</code></td>
<td>
<p>This argument specifies the number <code class="reqn">J</code> of windows to be
used, and defaults to <code class="reqn">J=2</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>The <code>Hangartner.Diagnostic</code> returns an object of class
<code>hangartner</code>, including the output from a Pearson's Chi-squared
test. A frequentist p-value less than or equal to 0.05 is usually
considered to be indicative of non-convergence.
