<h2>Data for a Randomized Block ANOVA</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Seven people, with differing amounts of muscle strength, took one of four different pre-workout supplements and then did a bench press of 125 lbs as many times as possible. Each person did four workouts at four different times, with a different supplement before each workout. The experimenter randomized the presentation order of the supplements to each person to avoid any artifacts from presentation order.</p>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data table with 7 rows of data and 5 columns: Person, and sup1 through sup4 for the four supplements.</p>
