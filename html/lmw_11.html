<h2>Plots diagnosing regression-implied weights</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Produces plots to diagnose properties of the weights, including their
distribution, to what degree the distribution of covariates involves
extrapolation in the weighted sample, and how much influence each unit has
on the effect estimate.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

plot(x, type = "weights", ...)

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>When <code>type = "weights"</code>, <code>plot.lmw()</code> produces a density plot of
the weights within each treatment group. By construction, these weights will
have a mean of 1. Some weights may be negative. The effective sample size
(ESS) and original sample size (N) will be displayed in the upper right
corner of the plot when <code>ess = TRUE</code>.
</p>
<p>When <code>type = "extrapolation"</code>, <code>plot.lmw()</code> produces a plot of the
distribution of weights and covariates for each treatment group. Each dot
represents a unit, with values arranged on the x-axis according to their
covariate value and the size of the dots corresponding to the magnitude of
the weight. Units with positive weights are displayed in black in the upper
portion of the plot, and units with negative weights are displayed in red in
the lower portion. Having many and large red points indicates a high degree
of extrapolation. All points are equally transparent, so darker regions
indicate multiple points with the same value. The vertical lines indicates
the weighted mean of the covariate in each group, and the X indicates the
mean of the covariate in the target sample as determined by the
<code>estimand</code> argument in the original call to <code>lmw()</code>. A large
discrepancy between the vertical lines and Xs indicates a lack of balance
between the treatment group and target sample. When <code>estimand = "CATE"</code>
in the original call to <code>lmw()</code>, any variables supplied to <code>variables</code>
that were not given a target value will not have the target mean displayed.
</p>
<p>When <code>type = "influence"</code>, <code>plot.lmw()</code> produces a plot of the
scaled sample influence curve (SIC) for each unit by index. It does so by
calling <code>influence.lmw()</code>, which fits the outcome model to extract
residuals and compute the SIC as <code>SIC = (N-1) * w * r / (1 - h)</code>, where
<code>N</code> is the sample size, <code>w</code> are the units' implied regression
weights, <code>r</code> are the residuals, and <code>h</code> are the hat values. SIC
values are scaled to have a maximum of 1. Higher values indicate greater
relative influence.

<p>A plot is displayed, and <code>x</code> is invisibly returned.
