<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The landscape connectivity metrics currently available are: 
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> NC – Number of components (groups of interconnected patches) in the 
landscape (Urban and Keitt, 2001). Patches in the same component are 
considered to be accessible, while patches in different components are not.
Highly connected landscapes have less components. Threshold dependent,
i.e., maximum distance for two patches to be considered connected, which 
can be interpreted as the maximum dispersal distance for a certain species.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> LNK – Number of links connecting the patches. The landscape is 
interpreted as binary, which means that the habitat patches are either
connected or not (Pascual-Hortal and Saura, 2006). Higher LNK implies 
higher connectivity. Threshold dependent, i.e., maximum distance for
two patches to be considered connected, which can be interpreted as 
the maximum dispersal distance for a certain species.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> SLC – Area of the largest group of interconnected patches 
(Pascual-Hortal and Saura, 2006). Threshold dependent, i.e., maximum 
distance for two patches to be considered connected, which can be 
interpreted as the maximum dispersal distance for a certain species.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> MSC – Mean area of interconnected patches 
(Pascual-Hortal and Saura, 2006). Threshold dependent, i.e., maximum 
distance for two patches to be considered connected, which can be 
interpreted as the maximum dispersal distance for a certain species. 
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> CCP – Class coincidence probability. It is defined as the probability 
that two randomly chosen points within the habitat belong to the same 
component (or cluster). Ranges between 0 and 1 (Pascual-Hortal and 
Saura, 2006). Higher CCP implies higher connectivity. Threshold dependent, 
i.e., maximum distance for two patches to be considered connected, which 
can be interpreted as the maximum dispersal distance for a certain species. 
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> LCP – Landscape coincidence probability. It is defined as the 
probability that two randomly chosen points in the landscape (whether in 
an habitat patch or not) belong to the same habitat component (or cluster).
Ranges between 0 and 1 (Pascual-Hortal and Saura, 2006). Threshold 
dependent, i.e., maximum distance for two patches to be considered 
connected, which can be interpreted as the maximum dispersal distance for a certain species.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> CPL – Characteristic path length. Mean of all the shortest paths 
between the habitat patches (Minor and Urban, 2008). The shorter the CPL 
value the more connected the patches are. Threshold dependent, i.e., 
maximum distance for two patches to be considered connected, which can be 
interpreted as the maximum dispersal distance for a certain species. 
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> ECS – Expected component (or cluster) size. Mean cluster size of the 
clusters weighted by area. (O’Brien et al., 2006 and Fall et al, 2007).
This represents the size of the component in which a randomly located 
point in an habitat patch would reside. Although it is informative 
regarding the area of the component, it does not provide any ecologically 
meaningful information regarding the total area of habitat. As an example: 
ECS increases with less isolated small components or patches, although the 
total habitat decreases (Laita et al. 2011). Threshold dependent, i.e., 
maximum distance for two patches to be considered connected, which 
can be interpreted as the maximum dispersal distance for a certain species.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> AWF – Area-weighted Flux. Evaluates the flow, weighted by area, 
between all pairs of patches (Bunn et al. 2000 and Urban and Keitt 2001). 
The probability of dispersal between two patches, was computed using 
pij=exp(-k * dij), where k is a constant making pij (the dispersal 
probability between patches) 50
defined by the user. Although k, as was implemented, is dependent on 
the dispersal distance, AWF is a probabilistic index and not 
directly dependent on the threshold. 
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> IIC – Integral index of connectivity. Index developed specifically 
for landscapes by Pascual-Hortal and Saura (2006). It is based on habitat 
availability and on a binary connection model (as opposed to a 
probabilistic). It ranges from 0 to 1 (higher values indicating more 
connectivity). Threshold dependent, i.e., maximum distance for two patches 
to be considered connected, which can be interpreted as the maximum 
dispersal distance for a certain species.

</ul>
