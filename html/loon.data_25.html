<p>"The collection of geolocated placenames in Canada represents a consistent and comprehensive 
distribution of named places across Canada. Named places include large and small cities, villages, 
First Nations Communities, Small Hamlets etc.
</p>
<p>"This data draws from public information maintained by Natural Resources Canada as part of 
the Canadian Geographical Names Database and public information maintained by Crown-Indigenous 
Relations and Northern Affairs Canada.
</p>
<p>"The set of geolocated placenames is currently used for the administration of rural broadband 
Internet contribution programs, but is equally applicable for other mapping or modelling purposes 
where a comprehensive set of geolocated placenames across Canada is required."
