<h3>Description</h3>

<p>htmlwidget for interactive views of R lists
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>R lists, especially nested lists, can be very difficult to visualize or
represent. <code>str</code> just isn't enough, so this suite of htmlwidgets is
designed to help see, understand, and maybe even modify your R lists.
