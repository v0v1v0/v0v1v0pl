<h2>Lake Geospatial Metadata</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A dataset containing geospatial identifiers, upstream lake connectivity, and
wetland connectivity of all lakes in LAGOSNE &gt;1 hectare.
</p>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 141271 observations and 31 variables:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> lagoslakeid: unique lake identifier in LAGOSNE

</li>
<li>
<p> lakes_nhdid: unique lake identifier from the National
Hydrography Dataset (NHD)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> iws_zoneid: zone ID of interlake watershed (IWS) in which
focal lake is located
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> hu4_zoneid: zone ID of HUC4 in which focal lake is
located
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> hu6_zoneid: zone ID of HUC6 in which focal lake is
located
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> hu8_zoneid: zone ID of HUC8 in which focal lake is
located
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> hu12_zoneid: zone ID of HU12 in which focal lake is
located
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> edu_zoneid: zone ID of ecological drainage unit (EDU) in
which focal lake is located
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> county_zoneid: zone ID of county in which focal lake is
located
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> state_zoneid: two-letter abbreviation of state in which
focal lake is located
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> upstream_lakes_4ha_count: count of lakes &gt;= 4 ha upstream of the focal lake,
connected via the NHD network of all surface flow connections
(defined as ephemeral, intermittent, or permanent streams, or any other connections)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> upstream_lakes_4ha_area_ha: total area of lakes &gt;= 4 ha upstream of the focal lake,
connected via the NHD network of all surface flow connections
(defined as ephemeral, intermittent, or permanent streams, or any other connections)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> upstream_lakes_10ha_count: count of lakes &gt;= 10 ha upstream of the focal lake,
connected via the NHD network of all surface flow connections
(defined as ephemeral, intermittent, or permanent streams, or any other connections)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> upstream_lakes_10ha_area_ha: total area of lakes &gt;= 10ha upstream of the focal lake,
connected via the NHD network of all surface flow connections
(defined as ephemeral, intermittent, or permanent streams, or any other connections)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> latewisconsinglaciation_glacial: glaciation status during the Late Wisconsin glaciation,
where 'Glaciated' where the whole zone was glaciated, 'Not_Glaciated' where the whole zone
was not glaciated, and 'Partially_Glaciated' where a part of the zone was glaciated
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> wlconnections_allwetlands_*: the wetland polygons that intersect or are
within 30 m buffer around a lake shoreline, measured as count, area (ha), or sum of
shoreline length (km) that intersects or touches wetland polygons
(* = count, contributing_area_ha, shoreline_km).
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> wlconnections_forestedwetlands_count: the forested wetland polygons that intersect or are
within 30 m buffer around a lake shoreline, measured as count, area (ha), or sum of
shoreline length (km) that intersects or touches wetland polygons
(* = count, contributing_area_ha, shoreline_km).
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> wlconnections_scrubshrubwetlands_count: the scrub-shrub wetland polygons that intersect or are
within 30 m buffer around a lake shoreline, measured as count, area (ha), or sum of
shoreline length (km) that intersects or touches wetland polygons
(* = count, contributing_area_ha, shoreline_km).
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> wlconnections_openwaterwetlands_count: the open water wetland polygons that intersect or are
within 30 m buffer around a lake shoreline, measured as count, area (ha), or sum of
shoreline length (km) that intersects or touches wetland polygons
(* = count, contributing_area_ha, shoreline_km).
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> wlconnections_otherwetlands_count: the other-wetland polygons that intersect or are
within 30 m buffer around a lake shoreline, measured as count, area (ha), or sum of
shoreline length (km) that intersects or touches wetland polygons
(* = count, contributing_area_ha, shoreline_km).
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> lakeconnection: connectivity of focal lake to upstream
features (DR_LakeStream = drainage lake with an upstream lake,
DR_Stream = drainage lake with upstream stream,
Headwater = lake with outlet but no inlet,
Isolated = lake with no inlets or outlets)
</p>
</li>
</ul>
