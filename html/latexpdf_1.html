<h2>Create LaTeX Code and PDF Documents.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><span class="pkg">latexpdf</span> helps you create pdf documents in R using
LaTeX techniques; this is especially useful for making stand-alone
PDF images of data.frames.  For report-length PDF, some flavor
of markup or markdown (e.g. Sweave, Rmarkdown) is probably a more
attractive mechanism for the main document; in this context, <span class="pkg">latexpdf</span>
can be used to embed tables with the same aesthetics as stand-alone
versions.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>"Anything in LaTeX can be expressed in terms of commands and environments",
(&lt;http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Absolute_Beginners&gt;). Accordingly,
<span class="pkg">latexpdf</span> provides R functions to generate LaTeX commands (command()) and
environments (wrap()).  For commands, care is taken to support options
and arguments. These can be used to create character vectors containing
arbitrary LaTeX code.
</p>
<p>In fact, the package itself uses these functions to convert data frames
to LaTeX code, providing reasonable defaults and supporting many
aesthetic interventions.  See '?as.tabular' and '?as.ltable' (tabular and
table environments, respectively).  See also 'vignette('tabular')
for a demonstration of options.
</p>
<p>While <span class="pkg">latexpdf</span> can be useful for low-level operations, creating PDF
documents directly is more powerful. Pre-generated LaTeX code can be inserted
into literate programming documents (Sweave, Rmarkdown) or can be auto-converted
to stand-alone PDF documents (see especially '?as.pdf.data.frame'). Functions
tex2pdf() and viewtex() create and visualize arbitrary tex code by converting to
PDF documents. They rely on as.pdf.document(), which places a system call
to 'pdflatex'.
</p>
<p>Some file formats, such as MS Word and Powerpoint, cannot embed PDF images.
Experimental support is available for converting PDF to PNG.  For example,
if you switch from Rmarkdown's pdf_document() to word_document(), you
may want to switch from as.pdf() to as.png() for your images.  PNG
functionality relies requires the local Ghostscript installation (see
'?ghostconvert') which is almost certainly present if 'pdflatex' is.
Ghostscript may be hard to find. See '?tools::find_gs_cmd'; for Miktex
installations, consider 'find_gs_cmd(gs_cmd = 'mgs')'.
