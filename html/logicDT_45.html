<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Three different VIM methods are implemented:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> Permutation VIMs: Random permutations of the respective
identified logic terms
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Removal VIMs: Removing single logic terms
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Logic VIMs: Prediction with both possible outcomes
of a logic term
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Details on the calculation of these VIMs are given below.
</p>
<p>By variable importance, importance of identified logic terms
is meant. These terms can be single predictors or
conjunctions between predictors in the spirit of this software package.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A data frame with two columns:
</p>
<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>var</code></td>
<td>
<p>Short descriptions of the terms for which the
importance was measured. For example <code>-X1^X2</code> for
<code class="reqn">X_1^c \land X_2</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>vim</code></td>
<td>
<p>The actual calculated VIM values.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>The rows of such a data frame are sorted decreasingly by the VIM values.
</p>


<h3>Permutation VIMs (Breiman &amp; Cutler, 2003)</h3>

<p>Permutation VIMs are computed by comparing the the model's
performance using the original data and data with random
permutations of single terms.
</p>


<h3>Removal VIMs</h3>

<p>Removal VIMs are constructed by removing specific logic
terms from the set of predictors, refitting the decision
tree and comparing the performance to the original model.
Thus, this approach requires that at least two terms were
found by the algorithm. Therefore, no VIM will be
calculated if <code>empty.model = "none"</code> was specified.
Alternatively, <code>empty.model = "mean"</code> can be set to
use the constant mean response model for approximating
the empty model.
</p>


<h3>Logic VIMs (Lau et al., 2024)</h3>

<p>Logic VIMs use the fact that Boolean conjunctions are
Boolean variables themselves and therefore are equal to
0 or 1. To compute the VIM for a specific term,
predictions are performed once for this term fixed to
0 and once for this term fixed to 1. Then, the arithmetic
mean of these two (risk or regression) predictions is
used for calculating the performance. This performance
is then compared to the original one as in the other
VIM approaches (<code>average = "before"</code>). Alternatively,
predictions for each fixed 0-1 scenario of the considered
term can be performed leading to individual performances
which then are averaged and compared to the original
performance (<code>average = "after"</code>).
</p>


<h3>Validation</h3>

<p>Validation data sets which
were not used in the fitting of the model are prefered
preventing an overfitting of the VIMs themselves.
These should be specified by the <code>_oob</code> arguments,
if neither bagging nor inner validation was used for fitting
the model.
</p>


<h3>Bagging</h3>

<p>For the bagging version, out-of-bag (OOB) data are naturally
used for the calculation of VIMs.
</p>


<h3>VIM Adjustment for Interactions (Lau et al., 2024)</h3>

<p>Since decision trees can naturally include interactions
between single predictors (especially when strong marginal
effects are present as well), logicDT models might, e.g.,
include the single input variables <code class="reqn">X_1</code> and <code class="reqn">X_2</code> but
not their interaction <code class="reqn">X_1 \land X_2</code> although an interaction
effect is present. We, therefore, developed and implemented an
adjustment approach for calculating VIMs for such
unidentified interactions nonetheless.
For predictors <code class="reqn">X_{i_1}, \ldots, X_{i_k} =: Z</code>, this interaction
importance is given by
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">\mathrm{VIM}(X_{i_1} \land \ldots \land X_{i_k}) =
\mathrm{VIM}(X_{i_1}, \ldots, X_{i_k} \mid X \setminus Z) -
\sum_{\lbrace j_1, \ldots, j_l \rbrace {\subset \atop \neq}
\lbrace i_1, \ldots, i_k \rbrace}
\mathrm{VIM}(X_{j_1} \land \ldots \land X_{j_l} \mid X \setminus Z)</code>
</p>

<p>and can basically be applied to all black-box models.
By <code class="reqn">\mathrm{VIM}(A \mid X \setminus Z)</code>, the VIM of <code class="reqn">A</code>
considering the predictor set excluding the variables in <code class="reqn">Z</code>
is meant, i.e., the improvement of additionally considering <code class="reqn">A</code>
while regarding only the predictors in <code class="reqn">X \setminus Z</code>.
The proposed interaction VIM can be recursively calculated through
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">\mathrm{VIM}(X_{i_1} \land X_{i_2}) =
\mathrm{VIM}(X_{i_1}, X_{i_2} \mid X \setminus Z) -
\mathrm{VIM}(X_{i_1} \mid X \setminus Z) -
\mathrm{VIM}(X_{i_2} \mid X \setminus Z)</code>
</p>

<p>for <code class="reqn">Z = X_{i_1}, X_{i_2}</code>.
This leads to the relationship
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">\mathrm{VIM}(X_{i_1} \land \ldots \land X_{i_k}) =
\sum_{\lbrace j_1, \ldots, j_l \rbrace \subseteq \lbrace i_1, \ldots, i_k \rbrace}
(-1)^{k-l} \cdot \mathrm{VIM}(X_{j_1}, \ldots, X_{j_l} \mid X \setminus Z).</code>
</p>



<h3>Identification of Specific Conjunctions (Lau et al., 2024)</h3>

<p>The aforementioned VIM adjustment approach only captures the importance
of a general definition of interactions, i.e., it just considers
the question whether some variables do interact in any way.
Since logicDT is aimed at identifying specific conjunctions (and also assigns
them VIMs if they were identified by <code>logicDT</code>), a further
adjustment approach is implemented which tries to identify the specific
conjunction leading to an interaction effect.
The idea of this method is to consider the response for each possible
scenario of the interacting variables, e.g., for <code class="reqn">X_1 \land (X_2^c \land X_3)</code>
where the second term <code class="reqn">X_2^c \land X_3</code> was identified by <code>logicDT</code>
and, thus, two interacting terms are regarded,
the <code class="reqn">2^2 = 4</code> possible scenarios
<code class="reqn">\lbrace (i, j) \mid i, j \in \lbrace 0, 1 \rbrace \rbrace</code>
are considered. For each setting, the corresponding response is compared with
outcome values of the complementary set. For continuous outcomes, a two sample
t-test (with Welch correction for potentially unequal variances) is performed
comparing the means between these two groups. For binary outcomes, Fisher's exact
test is performed testing different underlying case probabilities.
If at least one test rejects the null hypothesis of equal outcomes (without adjusting
for multiple testing), the combination with the lowest p-value is chosen as the
explanatory term for the interaction effect. For example, if the most significant
deviation results from <code class="reqn">X_1 = 0</code> and <code class="reqn">(X_2^c \land X_3) = 1</code> from the example
above, the term <code class="reqn">X_1^c \land (X_2^c \land X_3)</code> is chosen.
