<h2>Convert full waveform data into a regular point cloud</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Full waveform can be difficult to manipulate and visualize in R. This function converts
a LAS object with full waveform data into a regular point cloud. Each waveform record
becomes a point with XYZ coordinates and an amplitude (units: volts) and an ID that records
each original pulse. Notice that this has the effect of drastically inflating the size of the
object in memory, which is likely already very large
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">interpret_waveform(las)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>las</code></td>
<td>
<p>An object of class LAS with full waveform data</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>An object of class LAS 1.2 format 0 with one point per records
</p>


<h3>Full waveform</h3>

<p>With most recent versions of the <code>rlas</code> package, full waveform (FWF) can be read and <code>lidR</code>
provides some compatible functions. However, the support of FWF is still a work-in-progress
in the <code>rlas</code> package. How it is read, interpreted and represented in R may change. Consequently,
tools provided by <code>lidR</code> may also change until the support of FWF becomes mature and
stable in <code>rlas</code>. See also rlas::read.las.<br><br>
Remember that FWF represents an insanely huge amount of data. It terms of memory it is like
having between 10 to 100 times more points. Consequently, loading FWF data in R should be
restricted to relatively small point clouds.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">## Not run: 
LASfile &lt;- system.file("extdata", "fwf.laz", package="rlas")
fwf &lt;- readLAS(LASfile)
las &lt;- interpret_waveform(fwf)
x &lt;- plot(fwf, size = 3, pal = "red")
plot(las, color = "Amplitude", bg = "white", add = x, size = 2)

## End(Not run)
</code></pre>
