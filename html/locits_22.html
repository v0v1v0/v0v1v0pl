<h2>Produces a graphical representation of the results of a
test of stationarity contained in a <code>tos</code> object.
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>After a test of stationarity for dyadic data
(e.g. <code>hwtos2</code>)
is applied to a time series it generates a results object of
class <code>tos</code>. This function takes objects of that
class and produces a graphical representation of the test.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">## S3 method for class 'tos'
plot(x, mctype = "FDR", sub = NULL, xlab = "Time",
    arrow.length = 0.05, verbose = FALSE, ...)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>The <code>tos</code> class object, the results of the
test of stationarity that you wish to plot.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>mctype</code></td>
<td>
<p>Whether you wish to see rejections (if they exist)
according to a Bonferroni assessment (<code>"BON"</code>) or
according to FDR (<code>"FDR"</code>)</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>sub</code></td>
<td>
<p>An argument to change the subtitle.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>xlab</code></td>
<td>
<p>An argument to change the x-axis label.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>arrow.length</code></td>
<td>
<p>The length of the edges of the arrow
head (in inches). Note that this is the argument that is
supplied as the <code>length</code> argument of the <code>arrow</code>
function that is called by this routine to draw the arrows.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>verbose</code></td>
<td>
<p>If <code>TRUE</code> then some meaningless debugging
information is printed.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>...</code></td>
<td>

<p>Other arguments to the main <code>ts.plot</code> routine that
does the plotting.
</p>
</td>
</tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The following things are usually plotted. 1. The time series
that was investigated. The left-hand axes is that for the time series.
The horizontal axis is time (but just integers indexing).
If the series was deemed stationary by the test then that's it
except that the subtitle indicates that no Haar wavelet coefficients
were rejected as being nonzero.
</p>
<p>If the test indicated that the series was nonstationary then
the subtitle indicates this by stating the number of rejections
(this might be according to FDR or Bonferroni depending on 
the setting of the <code>mctype</code> argument. Then graphical
representations of any significant Haar wavelet coefficients
are plotted as double-headed red horizontal arrows on the plot.
The horizontal extent corresponds to the support of the underlying
wavelet. The vertical position of the arrows gives an indication
of the wavelet periodogram scale where the significant coefficient
was found. The wavelet periodogram scales are indexed by the right
hand axis, and beware, the numbers might not be consecutive, but
they will be ordered (so e.g. if no signficant coefficients were
discovered at wavelet periodogram scale level 6, then that scale/axis
label will not appear). The scale within the Haar wavelet transform
is indicated by the vertical position WITHIN ticks between
wavelet periodogram scales (ie, there are TWO scales: the wavelet
periodogram scale that is currently being analyzed, and the
Haar wavelet transform scale within the periodogram scale).
So, if two right hand axis labels are, e.g., 4 and 5, and
horizontal arrows appear between these two they actually correspond
to different Haar wavelet transform scales AT wavelet periodogram
level 4. It is not usually possible to tell precisely which
Haar wavelet transform scale the coefficients can come from,
but the information can be extracted from the <code>summary.tos</code>
function which lists this.
