<h2>Pre-calculate the change point proposal distribution for the ptMCMC 
algorithm</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Calculate the proposal distribution in advance of actually
running the ptMCMC algorithm in order to decrease computation time.
The proposal distribution is a joint of three distributions:
[1] a multinomial distribution selecting among the change points within
the chain, [2] a binomial distribution selecting the direction of the 
step of the change point (earlier or later in the time series), and 
[3] a geometric distribution selecting the magnitude of the step.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">prep_proposal_dist(nchangepoints, control = list())
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>nchangepoints</code></td>
<td>
<p>Integer corresponding to the number of 
change points to include in the model. 0 is a valid input (corresponding
to no change points, so a singular time series model), and the current 
implementation can reasonably include up to 6 change points. The 
number of change points is used to dictate the segmentation of the data  
for each continuous model and each LDA model.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>control</code></td>
<td>
<p>A <code>list</code> of parameters to control the fitting of the
Time Series model including the parallel tempering Markov Chain 
Monte Carlo (ptMCMC) controls. Values not input assume defaults set by 
<code>TS_control</code>. Currently relevant here is 
<code>magnitude</code>, which controls the magnitude of the step size (is the 
average of the geometric distribution).</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p><code>list</code> of two <code>matrix</code> elements: [1] the size of the 
proposed step for each iteration of each chain and [2] the identity of 
the change point location to be shifted by the step for each iteration of
each chain.
