<h2>Combined List Estimator</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function implements the combined list estimator described in Aronow,
Coppock, Crawford, and Green (2015): Combining List Experiment and Direct
Question Estimates of Sensitive Behavior Prevalence
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">combinedListDirect(
  formula,
  data = parent.frame(),
  treat = "treat",
  direct = "direct"
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>formula</code></td>
<td>
<p>an object of class "formula" (or one that can be coerced to
that class): a symbolic description of the model to be fitted. Should be of
the form Y ~ T + X1 + X2, where Y is the list response, T is the treatment
indicator, and X1, X2, etc are pretreatment covariates. It is recommended
that T be a numeric variable whose values are 0 for subjects in control and
1 for subjects in treatment.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>data</code></td>
<td>
<p>an optional data frame, list or environment (or object coercible
by as.data.frame to a data frame) containing the variables in the model. If
not found in data, the variables are taken from environment(formula),
typically the environment from which combined.list is called. It is good
practice to include all variables used in the estimation (list response,
treatment indicator, direct response, and optional pre-treatment covariates)
in a dataframe rather than calling data from the global environent.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>treat</code></td>
<td>
<p>a character string giving the name of the treatment variable.
Defaults to "treat".</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>direct</code></td>
<td>
<p>a character string giving the name of the direct response
variable. Defaults to "direct". The direct response variable itself must
only contain the values 0 and 1, where 1 refers to subjects who answered
"Yes" to the direct question.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>a list containing conventional, direct, and combined prevalence
estimates with associated standard errors as well as the results of two
placebo tests.
</p>
