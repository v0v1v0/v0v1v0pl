<h2>Epilimnion Water Quality Data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A dataset containing physical and chemical observations in the epilimnion
(surface waters).
Each row is a sampling event, and lakes can have multiple sampling events.
</p>

<p> ton: nitrogen, total organic (µg/l as N)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> tp: phosphorus, total (µg/l as P)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> secchi: Secchi disk transparency (m).
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> *_qual: data flags (qualifiers) from the source program
for each water quality parameter (* = all water quality
parameters listed above). For example, "chla_qual" is the
variable name for the data flag for chlorophyll a observations.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> *_censorcode: identifies whether a data value is censored
and the censor type for each water quality parameter (* = all
water quality parameters listed above). For example,
"chla_censorcode" is the variable name for censor information
regarding chlorophyll a observations.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> NC1: has detection limit and data value is above
detection limit and has no qualifier or comments
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> NC2: has detection limit and data value is above
detection limit, and has qualifier or comments
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> NC3: has no detection limit and has qualifier or
comments
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> NC4: has no detection limit and has no qualifiers or
comments
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> LE1: has detection limit, data value is less than or
equal to detection limit, has qualifier or comments
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> LE2: has detection limit, data value is less than or
equal to detection limit, has no qualifier or comments
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> LE3: has no detection limit, &lt; than comes from source
program, has qualifier or comments
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> LE4: has no detection limit, &lt; than comes from source
program, has no qualifier or comments
</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p> *_detectionlimit: the detection limit used by the source
program for each water quality parameter (* = all water quality
parameters listed above). For example, "chla_detectionlimit" is
the name of the variable that reports detection limits for
chlorophyll a observations.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> *_labmethodname: analytical procedure, from a standards
body if available for each water quality parameter (* = all
water quality parameters listed above). For example,
"chla_labmethodname" is the variable name for lab methods
associated with each chlorophyll a observation.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> chla_methodinfo: flag to indicate variable was sampled
using different methods. "CHLA_UNFILTERED" means that a sample
was
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> secchi_methodinfo: flag to indicate variable was sampled
using different methods. "SECCHI_VIEW" means that Secchi depth
was measured using a viewer box, whereas "SECCHI_VIEW_UNKNOWN"
reports observations where it is unclear if a Secchi viewer box
was used. A secchi observation without a methodinfo code means
the Secchi depth was made without the viewer box.
