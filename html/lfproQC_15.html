<h2>Yeast lysate - UPS1 benchmark dataset</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This dataset was given by Ramus et al., (2016). It is based on a highly complex sample (yeast lysate) spiked with different spiked amounts of the UPS1 standard mixture of 48 recombinant proteins. 
The original dataset contains 2644 rows of proteins and 2 groups of samples with three replicates each. 
From the original dataset, only the pairwise comparison of 50vs0.5 has taken here. This dataset
contains 874 rows of proteins which includes 48 spiked-in ups proteins in the yeast.

</dl>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This standard proteomic dataset is suitable for benchmarking and comparing software for label-free quantification. 
And can also be applied to the evaluation of post-processing steps such as normalization, imputation of missing values, and statistical methods.
