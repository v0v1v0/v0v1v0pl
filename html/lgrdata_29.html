<h2>Pupae data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This dataset is from an experiment where larvae were
left to feed on <em>Eucalyptus</em> leaves, in a glasshouse that was
controlled at two different levels of temperature and CO$_2$ concentration.
After the larvae pupated (that is, turned into pupae), the body weight
was measured, as well as the cumulative 'frass' (larvae excrement) over the
entire time it took to pupate.
