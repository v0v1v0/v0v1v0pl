<h2>Burn-in</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The <code>burnin</code> function estimates the duration of burn-in in
iterations for one or more Markov chains. “Burn-in” refers to the
initial portion of a Markov chain that is not stationary and is still
affected by its initial value.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">burnin(x, method="BMK")
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>This is a vector or matrix of posterior samples for which a
the number of burn-in iterations will be estimated.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>method</code></td>
<td>
<p>This argument defaults to <code>"BMK"</code>, in which case
stationarity is estimated with the <code>BMK.Diagnostic</code>
function. Alternatively, the <code>Geweke.Diagnostic</code>
function may be used when <code>method="Geweke"</code> or the
<code>KS.Diagnostic</code> function may be used when
<code>method="KS"</code>.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Burn-in is a colloquial term for the initial iterations in a Markov
chain prior to its convergence to the target distribution. During
burn-in, the chain is not considered to have “forgotten” its initial
value.
</p>
<p>Burn-in is not a theoretical part of MCMC, but its use is the norm
because of the need to limit the number of posterior samples due to
computer memory. If burn-in were retained rather than discarded, then
more posterior samples would have to be retained. If a Markov chain
starts anywhere close to the center of its target distribution, then
burn-in iterations do not need to be discarded.
</p>
<p>In the <code>LaplacesDemon</code> function, stationarity is estimated
with the <code>BMK.Diagnostic</code> function on all thinned
posterior samples of each chain, beginning at cumulative 10% intervals
relative to the total number of samples, and the lowest number in
which all chains are stationary is considered the burn-in.
</p>
<p>The term, “burn-in”, originated in electronics regarding the initial
testing of component failure at the factory to eliminate initial
failures (Geyer, 2011). Although “burn-in' has been the standard term
for decades, some are referring to these as “warm-up” iterations.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>The <code>burnin</code> function returns a vector equal in length to the
number of MCMC chains in <code>x</code>, and each element indicates the
maximum iteration in burn-in.
