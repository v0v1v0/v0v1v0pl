<h2>Class <code>"gridList"</code>. A  description of a regular and 
multidimensional grid.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This object is mainly designed to work with methods that take a 
set of locations organized on a grid. The object is a list where
there are as many components as dimensions and  each list component is a vector of values being the grid points in that dimension. It is consistent with the older use of the older <code>grid.list</code> format used in the fields package.
This form is somewhat redundant because for an equally spaced grid all one needs is the beginning value, spacing and number of points but it makes it simpler to pass the grid information to functions such as image and contour. 
</p>



<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">gridListInfo(gridList)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>gridList</code></td>
<td>
<p>A gridList object.</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Objects from the Class</h3>

<p>This object is a list where each component is a vector of 
grid points in a particular dimension. For example
</p>
<p><code> grid&lt;- structure(list( x= seq( -1,1,,20), y= seq( 0,1,,15)), class= "gridList"</code> 
</p>
<p>would create this object for a 2d grid with 20 and 15 points over the 
ranges [-1,1] and [0,1]. 
The component names ( "x" and "y" in this case) are optional. 
</p>
<p>The function <code>gridListInfo</code> extracts some summary information that is used to support the summary function for this class.
