<h2>Bayes' Theorem</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Bayes' theorem shows the relation between two conditional
probabilities that are the reverse of each other. This theorem is
named after Reverend Thomas Bayes (1702-1761), and is also referred to
as Bayes' law or Bayes' rule (Bayes and Price, 1763). Bayes' theorem
expresses the conditional probability, or ‘posterior probability’, of
an event <code class="reqn">A</code> after <code class="reqn">B</code> is observed in terms of the 'prior
probability' of <code class="reqn">A</code>, prior probability of <code class="reqn">B</code>, and the
conditional probability of <code class="reqn">B</code> given <code class="reqn">A</code>. Bayes' theorem is
valid in all common interpretations of probability. This function
provides one of several forms of calculations that are possible with
Bayes' theorem.

<p>This required argument is the conditional probability of

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Bayes' theorem provides an expression for the conditional probability
of <code class="reqn">A</code> given <code class="reqn">B</code>, which is equal to
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">\Pr(A | B) = \frac{\Pr(B | A)\Pr(A)}{\Pr(B)}</code>
</p>

<p>For example, suppose one asks the question: what is the probability of
going to Hell, conditional on consorting (or given that a person
consorts) with Laplace's Demon. By replacing <code class="reqn">A</code> with <code class="reqn">Hell</code>
and <code class="reqn">B</code> with <code class="reqn">Consort</code>, the question becomes
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">\Pr(\mathrm{Hell} | \mathrm{Consort}) =
  \frac{\Pr(\mathrm{Consort} |
  \mathrm{Hell})\Pr(\mathrm{Hell})}{\Pr(\mathrm{Consort})}</code>
</p>

<p>Note that a common fallacy is to assume that <code class="reqn">\Pr(A | B) = \Pr(B |
    A)</code>, which is called the conditional
probability fallacy.
</p>
<p>Another way to state Bayes' theorem (and this is the form in the
provided function) is
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">\Pr(A_i | B) = \frac{\Pr(B | A_i)\Pr(A_i)}{\Pr(B | A_i)\Pr(A_i)
  +\dots+ \Pr(B | A_n)\Pr(A_n)}</code>
</p>

<p>Let's examine our <em>burning</em> question, by replacing
<code class="reqn">A_i</code> with Hell or Heaven, and replacing <code class="reqn">B</code> with
Consort
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><code class="reqn">\Pr(A_1) = \Pr(\mathrm{Hell})</code>
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code class="reqn">\Pr(A_2) = \Pr(\mathrm{Heaven})</code>
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code class="reqn">\Pr(B) = \Pr(\mathrm{Consort})</code>
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code class="reqn">\Pr(A_1 | B) = \Pr(\mathrm{Hell} |
    \mathrm{Consort})</code>
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code class="reqn">\Pr(A_2 | B) = \Pr(\mathrm{Heaven} |
    \mathrm{Consort})</code>
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code class="reqn">\Pr(B | A_1) = \Pr(\mathrm{Consort} |
    \mathrm{Hell})</code>
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code class="reqn">\Pr(B | A_2) = \Pr(\mathrm{Consort} |
    \mathrm{Heaven})</code>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Laplace's Demon was conjured and asked for some data. He was glad to
oblige.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> 6 people consorted out of 9 who went to Hell.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> 5 people consorted out of 7 who went to Heaven.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> 75% of the population goes to Hell.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> 25% of the population goes to Heaven.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, Bayes' theorem is applied to the data. Four pieces are worked out
as follows
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><code class="reqn">\Pr(\mathrm{Consort} | \mathrm{Hell}) = 6/9 =
    0.666</code>
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code class="reqn">\Pr(\mathrm{Consort} | \mathrm{Heaven}) = 5/7 =
    0.714</code>
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code class="reqn">\Pr(\mathrm{Hell}) = 0.75</code>
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code class="reqn">\Pr(\mathrm{Heaven}) = 0.25</code>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, the desired conditional probability <code class="reqn">\Pr(\mathrm{Hell} |
    \mathrm{Consort})</code> is calculated using Bayes'
theorem
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><code class="reqn">\Pr(\mathrm{Hell} | \mathrm{Consort}) =
    \frac{0.666(0.75)}{0.666(0.75) + 0.714(0.25)}</code>
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code class="reqn">\Pr(\mathrm{Hell} | \mathrm{Consort}) = 0.737</code>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The probability of someone consorting with Laplace's Demon and going
to Hell is 73.7%, which is less than the prevalence of 75% in the
population. According to these findings, consorting with Laplace's
Demon does not increase the probability of going to Hell.
